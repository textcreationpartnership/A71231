            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:33295:2"/>
            <head>AN ADMONITION TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat it is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion to call an <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader,</hi> or, if it be ſomewhat longer, a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> the Author ſtiled an <hi>Admonition,</hi> or <hi>Advertiſement to the Reader,</hi> that by a more unuſual title he might the more ſurely draw him to read it, before he doth the Book.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:33295:3"/>
            <p>And the firſt thing, which he admoniſheth thee of, Good Reader, is, that thou neither queſtion nor ſcruple what judgment he is of, before thou haſt conſidered what he here ſaith: nor that when thou ſhalt have read a little way into the Book, thou make ſuch conjectures of its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors opinion, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the book fit onely to be laid aſide by thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he, who writ it, may haply diſcent from thee in
<pb facs="tcp:33295:3"/> ſome matters. He very little meddles with any matters here, in which it is likely that any ſober Chriſtian diſcents from him. A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relliſhing expreſſion, or a chapter, ſhould not be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant enough to thee for thy ſentencing him this or that, and rejecting what elſe he ſays for thine and common good. Perhaps he may make mention of a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer-book,</hi> or <hi>Holy days,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to draw in them, who will hear of no devotion
<pb facs="tcp:33295:4"/> which rejects theſe, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrate it ſtill as <hi>Fanatical,</hi> to the reading his Book, and thereby to a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Chriſtian uſe of thoſe things, than what all are guilty of. Perhaps, on the other ſide, he may be in good earneſt, and thinking them right Chriſtian and uſeful, commend them to thy practice, and direct thee, ſo to uſe them, as that thou ſhalt by ſuch uſe of them begin leſs to quarrel with them. Either deſign is
<pb facs="tcp:33295:4"/> honeſt, and it is no matter whether it is, which he hath, nor who, or what he is. He would onely have thee to take him for a man of ſerious and ſober princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and one who would have all that profeſs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to be ſuch alſo: (and ſuch thou muſt either take him to be, or elſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thou knoweſt him not, and ſo canſt not know him to be otherwiſe, thou art uncharitable: ) And as being ſuch, that, which he
<pb facs="tcp:33295:5"/> endeavours here, is to bring thee ſeriouſly upon thy knees before God, there to examine thine heart and actions according to that Chriſtian rule, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly enjoynes thee Charity, Meekneſs, Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Peaceableneſs, and ſuch ſweet Virtues; which if thou do but uſe thy ſelf to, thou wilt judge thy ſelf no otherwiſe a Chriſtian than as theſe Chriſtian Graces are in thee, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as a new-born babe,
<pb facs="tcp:33295:5"/> the ſincere milk of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of godlineſs, come it to thee in what veſſels ſoever.</p>
            <p>Another thing, which he hath to adviſe thee of, is matter of direction in the uſe of this Book: in which caſe his deſire to thee is, that thou wilt firſt read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Table, which is at the beginning of it, and mark the ſubſtance of what he there promiſeth to treat of; that then, if thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to make uſe of this
<pb facs="tcp:33295:6"/> method for thy devotion (and, the Author thinks thou wilt, if thou have the patience to conſider it, and canſt obtain leiſure of thy ſelf to practice it) that thou wilt read the Book once or twice over, and endeavour, by attent conſideration, to underſtand it; and when thou haſt once got the Book thus into thine head, the practice will ſoon grow eaſie (he is ſure, at leaſt, moſt ſweet and bleſſedly delightful. ) Be but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb facs="tcp:33295:6"/> to try it one month or two, and ſee if thou canſt find in thy heart to be ſo injurious to thine own fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, as to lay it aſide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Somewhat too there ſhould be ſaid as to what is likely to be objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the contents hereof. It may haply be conceived, there are here ſome practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces directed to in ordinary Devotions, which are too high for every mans reach (as is meditating upon
<pb facs="tcp:33295:7"/> Scripture, in ſuch ſort as is here taught, endeavouring the mortification of ſin in ſuch rational methods, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> ſome circumſtances too, as to the place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, unneceſſary, or above moſt mens conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to the former of which, the Authors an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that patterns of this nature muſt not be ſet too low, for that men are apt rather to aim under than over; that he thinks there is very little of practice
<pb facs="tcp:33295:7"/> here, by which a plain ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity may not underſtand ſomewhat, which he will conclude to be his duty, though it may be he reach not all in that caſe; and further both as to this and to the latter point ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be objected, that the higher matters and more curious circumſtances are commended onely to men of abilities, eſtates and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſuitable: Let all go as high as they can, and their devotions will be ſure to
<pb facs="tcp:33295:8"/> be more compleat, than if they had aimed lower.</p>
            <p>Now, which is all that ſhall be added, poſſibly ſome may think ſuch Books as theſe needleſs at preſent, after ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in this kind already. Hereunto the Authors A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology might be, that the number of ſuch books is much at preſent leſſened by thoſe mercileſs flames, out of which the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God ſaved this Book (when it was in a
<pb facs="tcp:33295:8"/> manner all printed off ſave this Preface) that this preſervation of it is ſome excuſe for its appearance, and preſage that it may not be altogether fruitleſs: But this being waved, that which was his anſwer in the Preface, which thoſe forementioned flames con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, when the Book it ſelf eſcaped, is, that he is not much read in our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh books, and ſo knows not what or how many of this nature are extant; but
<pb facs="tcp:33295:9"/> that of thoſe, which it hath been his lot to ſee, he knows none, which do more aim at the hitting the genius and humour of every mans devotion (be he of what judgment he will) than he hath done in this; and that, be the Reader a conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon, or any of the contrary perſwaſions, if he be but ſerious, and reſolved not to reject the main, which he cannot but like, for a page or two, which though he may not much brook,
<pb facs="tcp:33295:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> yet he can ſcarce be very angry with; the Author be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ſuch perſon will not think his pains to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: However, that, in this hope he cannot but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that the meer wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and publiſhing hereof will be a perpetual engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to himſelf of a more ſtrict and circumſpect life; and that therefore, if in none other, yet in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, it comes not forth in vain.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33295:14"/> the company of his neereſt friends, preſenting himſelf alone before God: For that beſides the worſhip of God, which we performe to him in the <hi>publick aſſemblies,</hi> and joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the reſt of the <hi>Family,</hi> of which we are members, beſides, I ſay, praying, hearing, and receiving, &amp;c. in the Church, and praying with the people of our own houſe, there are ſeveral religious duties to be performed by us, without which the power of godlineſſe can never be kept alive in our hearts, nor the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which before or with others we do unto God almighty, be through hearty and compleat; which duties I ſay can never be performed as they ſhould be, if we are in company. To wit,</p>
                  <p>Firſt it is indiſpenſibly neceſſary that a Chriſtian often examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, take account of his own ſtate and actions, whether his heart be ſo ſted faſt in holy purpoſes as it hath been or ought to be, or as he hath vowed to God it ſhould be: whether his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33295:14"/> practices of late have been anſwer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuch reſolutions and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as he hath made: or whether his heart be more indifferent and careleſs than it was, his actions more looſe and irregular; This, I ſay, is abſolutely neceſſary to an holy life: for that without it he may inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly go back and grow worſe, he may delay his returns unto God, or not return after ſeveral wandrings, and (if ſuddenly catcht) die without the particular repentance of many ſins.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is as neceſſary that a Chriſtian confeſſe himſelf to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that is, that having taken ſuch an account of his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, he acknowledg them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile them and beg pardon of them before God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe repentance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without reformation, it is neceſſary that he conſult and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with himſelf how he may grow better; what occaſions of his ſins there were, which may be avoided;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33295:15"/> what means of the contrary virtues, which may be uſed; and reſolve ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly with himſelf, that theſe and theſe occaſions he will avoid, theſe and theſe means uſe.</p>
                  <p>Now foraſmuch as ſuch reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can never be upright and firme, except made with deliberation, heed and thoughtfullneſs; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as ſuch deliberation cannot be taken in company, nor all things duly weighed, where we have a crowd of occaſions and objects to take of our thoughts, it is therefore neceſſary that for ſuch work we be alone: and in the other caſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that examination of our ſelves muſt needs be very ſlighty &amp; ſhort, which we make while we ſit and talk with others; becauſe alſo thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, which we make in publick or with others, may be, and moſt frequently are, too generall to reach our particular caſes and ſins, it is therefore neceſſary for the doing of them alſo, that we retire or go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:33295:15"/>
                  <p>And to Conclude, becauſe he that would keep himſelf cloſe to the waies of holineſs, muſt do all theſe things often, it is therefore neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he be often alone, at leaſt as often as with any tollerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience he can, and, to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if his condition admitt or will afford it, that he have a place conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to retire to, which we will call a <hi>Cloſet.</hi>

I ſay, not by <hi>Me:</hi> for what ever it is to others to me ought it to be reverend. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when our ordinary occaſions call us into our through Churches, we uſually out of Reverence to him, to whom thoſe places are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted, and in memory of thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall feaſts, which we or our Chriſtian brethren have there and in ſuch places taſted, fall down on our knees and worſhip God, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his bleſſing upon us &amp; his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as often as there aſſembled, and praiſing him for the benefits, which we or his people have there partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of; ſo when I come, though up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on common matters, into my clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, yet conſidering with my ſelf, that I am now in that place, where
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33295:18"/> in I have ſo often worſhipped (or at leaſt reſolved often to worſhip) God, and had ſweet converſe with him, in memory thereof, and for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons hereafter mentioned I would kneel down and pray, to this or the like effect.</p>
                  <p>My good God, whom I here frequently and with my heart worſhip, Bleſs me I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee in the affaires I go about. Keep my heart with thee, at leaſt ever keep it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right before thee: And as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as I here preſent my ſelf, let thy good Spirit be preſent with me, to diſpoſe me unto, and aſſiſt me in thy ſervice, through Jeſus Chriſt my Lord and Saviour. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>If any think they are excuſed from private prayer twice a day, by their praying twice a day with the Family, of which they are a part, They are to underſtand, that there is no particular ſtrict command, touching the nature of our daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, preſcribing them to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publick, or private, or both: but that it is moſt juſt and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that <hi>God ſhould have a liberal part of our time, as well as of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Dr. Ham: Pract. Catech.

Further, God hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in joyned me the duty of prayer, but left the particular frequency of it, after the nature of other freewill offerings, to my Chriſtian diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ought not to be therefore the more heedleſs: but rather, becauſe I know my ſacrifice will be ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted how often ſoever brought with an honeſt heart, out of an holy
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33295:21"/> ambition of pleaſing God and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up an odour of a ſweet ſavour unto heaven, to bring it as often as I can: And ſurely twice a day I may preſent even my private devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>If I be ſingle and in my own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, there is no queſtion but I may: If I be the Maſter or Miſtris of a Family, there is little queſtion of it: If I be a ſervant, or one who works for my living, there is indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the more queſtion; for that not only I may be ſtraightned in time, but want the conveniency of privacy. But, yet even in this caſe, what hinders, but that being I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do ſo well as I would, I may do ſo well as I can? to wit, riſing one piece of an hour ordinarily ſooner, or lying down ſo much lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fall down upon my knees by my ſelf at my beds ſide, and privately poure out my confeſſions and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers before God. And what if my fellow ſervant be with me? Why ſhould I be aſhamed to do, before
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33295:22"/> him, what he cannot but acknowledg he alſo ought to do? ſhall I not one day much more bluſh and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at the omiſsion of my duty before <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>God</hi> himſelf, than here at the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it?

That which is eternall, or this, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have once or twice deſpiſed, I ſhall be troubled with no more? Begin to do ſo, and after the firſt or ſecond time, thou wilt never be aſhamed of it: I aſſure thee at leaſt thou wilt never repent.</p>
                  <p>This then ſhould be my ordinary retirement twice a day.</p>
                  <p>Our more ſpecial retirement ought to be upon <hi>Lords daies, Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies,</hi> and our own <hi>private Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies,</hi> each of which will come here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be conſidered.

What is it of worldly goods, which will not paſs away (at leaſt as to me and my injoyment of it) with my ſelf? I dying, all dyes with me: my eſtate, my honours, my friends, and all ſuch, are no more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to me, when death once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; but haply a torment, being that they are all now to be left. It is therefore but to the end of my

Perhaps one Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, perhaps more. So then all thoſe things, which my other time ſeeks, are of a pitifull ſhort and tranſient concernment. But the graces of Gods ſpirit, an holy heart a good conſcience, reconciliation with my heavenly Father, theſe, and ſuch like, are not only of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for my preſent happineſs but for my eternall. The richeſt honorableſt and moſt worldly-happy Man, if devoid of grace, an enemy unto God, conſcious to himſelf of villany, cannot in all his abundance here enjoy or like himſelf, much leſs either account himſelf, or be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, an happy perſon.

                  <note place="margin">Job. 10. 11.</note> His <hi>workes follow</hi> him and his <hi>wayes</hi> meet him.

And is this a deſirable end for a man all his dayes to be driving at; to be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in life by reaſon of an evill conſcience, or an impoſſibility of lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and loving himſelf; to be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in death, by the advancing of that diſquiet, his former torment; and moſt miſerable after death by the perfection of that and all other miſchiefs? Whereas, if ſome of thoſe dayes which the world employed been taken up in ſeeking unto God, how might that portion have ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all the reſt, have led him to a

Not to mention that unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſatisfaction, which the hearty performance of ſuch devotions, through the bloud of Chriſt, would have filled him with, which we may hereafter conſider.

And it being the genuine Evangelicall ſenſe of the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, Keep all thy life an <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſt from doing thy own workes delighting thy ſelf</hi> and acquieſcing

Or ſuppoſe that this law would not in equity bind me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto (which yet it ſeems to do) is it not reaſonable, that there ſhould be free will offerings of our time as well as of our eſtates? And will there be any better way found for the imploying of what we can ſpare thereof, than the thus ſanctifiing and devoting it unto God? I am confident whatever mens practices may be, their conſciences cannot gainſay but do highly approve and commend to them what is preſſed. We may complain fondly of the <hi>ſhortneſſe of time:</hi> but evident it is that we ſpend much upon this world; much upon our games, much upon our pleaſures, much upon our ambitions, much alſo upon thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary acts of life, Eating, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sleeping, and much to upon (God knowes) we know not what.

Do ſo but one week o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the iſſue will be of theſe two, the own either my whole time hath been really imployed, and that upon my common affaires and neceſſary care of my body, or elſe ſome part of it (to wit, ſo much as hath not been imployed) hath been trifled away. Now <hi>(utrum horum)</hi> Let me take which I pleaſe. If it be ſuppoſed all to have been imployed, is it not moſt unreaſonable, that worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe and my body ſhould have all, and God and my ſoul have none, or next to none? Did God make me for himſelf, and allot me ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33295:26"/> of time for his glory and for proviſion for my ſoul, and are they only ſome few minutes, which I can find either for him or it? Was, I ſay, every day given me for theſe ends, and can I ſpend all without conſiderable ſeeking either, as I do if I allow nothing to private devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Ought I not therefore to leſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en my buſineſſe, rather than neglect the great ends of my being? If, on the other ſide, a conſiderable part of my time were loſt and trifled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way (as I dare ſay infallibly it will appear upon due account taken) is not this a moſt unreaſonable part in me, that I can find time to looſe, and yet no time to pray?</p>
               <p>And further, Thirdly, it may ſomewhat quicken me, if I conſider, that though it ſhould be queſtioned whether it be ſtrictly my duty <hi>thus and thus oft to pray,</hi> becauſe there may ſeem to be wanting an expreſſe command, yet I cannot but be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it is my duty <hi>to pray, and to pray often,</hi> (for, this there are not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33295:27"/> wanting commands) and that therefore prayer being a duty and well pleaſing unto God, the more thereof is performed, the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſervice do I do to God: provided, prayer thruſt not out my other duties. The frequency, I ſay, can never offend, except in the caſe of neglecting other duties to per. forme it: and herein commonly men are not apt to be guilty. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it therefore not to offend in this caſe being that it is a duty, it muſt pleaſe, and pleaſe the more, by how much it ſelf is more. Now this to ingenuity is no mean incentive unto prayer, that hereby I pleaſe my God, and delight heaven.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Let me conſider, that as Prayer it ſelf is the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and effectuall means, that a Chriſtian can uſe for the effecting of all he would, ſo there is no prayer more powerfull than that which is moſt frequent and importunate. In generall as to the power of prayer, it is ſuch that it ſeems to have done
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33295:27"/> violence to omnipotency it ſelf; as in the caſe of Moſes when God as though graciouſly held or reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bids him <hi>lot him alone:</hi> and in <note place="margin">Exo. 32. 10 Iſai. 45. 2.</note> ſome cauſes, if duly performed, God hath as it were allowed it to <hi>command</hi> him. But what or whoſe prayers are they, which are thus powerfull? Surely not theirs, who ſo ſeldom come to heaven, that if it were for nothing elſe, but becauſe they are ſuch ſtrangers, they would not ſpeed: but theirs rathers, whoſe daily and frequent application of themſelves to the throne of grace, hath rendred them there well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted and favourites. We may therefore obſerve, that <hi>the moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and encouraging promiſes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard, are made to the importun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſuitors.</hi> The widdow in the <note place="margin">Luk. 18.</note> parable, whom injuſtice it ſelf could not deny, was ſuch, and therefore ſped becauſe ſuch, becauſe ſhe came ſo often. And that precept, each gradation of which hath a promiſe proportionably attemporated and

               <p>Now becauſe all theſe things are ſo, therefore can it not be but that the <hi>benefit</hi> of ſuch practice muſt be <hi>unſpeakable,</hi> which as another (and for the preſent the laſt) incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto daily private devotion is worthy my conſideration. Firſt, as to the inward temper of my heart
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33295:28"/> (which rightly to diſpoſe, and ſo diſpoſed to keep, is a matter of the greateſt concernment to an holy life) there can be nothing thought of more effectual than ſuch practice, nor can it indeed well be conceived, how that mans heart can be kept in a thorow ſenſe of his duty, and cloſe with God, who maintaines not ſome ſuch daily courſe of devotion as is under preſent conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The maintaining hereof will keep alive in me a continual fear and awfull apprehenſion of God: it will habituate me, in all my wayes, often to think upon and remember him. Now there is nothing, the apprehenſion of which is of more wholeſome conſequence unto a man, than of God and his all-ſeeing eye. One, who is ſenſible and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hereof, cannot be long vain, but, if he do forget himſelf at any time, will ſoon return to his old ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33295:29"/> as we now ſpeak thereof, is nothing elſe but the due diſpoſition and reſolution of the ſoul, which as is evident will be the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent and fruit of ſuch prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it will have a very wholeſome influence upon my life, as in all caſes elſe, ſo eſpecially in this, that I ſhall at no time carry on any deſigne, which I dare not bring unto the teſt of heaven, and beg thereon the bleſſing of the God of Holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the mercies which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in my own perſon, in my rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in all my affaires as procured and impetrated from God by theſe my daily and frequent prayers will be innumerable; and that inward comfort and clearneſſe of heart, with which I ſhall entertain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe mercies, or any thing elſe, which comes from the hand of my gracious God, inexpreſſible. The ſame mercies evidenlty are not the ſame to all men, no more than

               <p>Now the conſideration of all, which I have thus meditated, cannot ſure but move me to ſome meaſure of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in theſe duties. If therefore at any time negligence begin to grow over me, it may be of good effect to read over and duly to weigh theſe or the like motives, that I may be quickened to reſume, and proceed with, my propoſed courſe: and what that courſe ſhould be, it followes in the next place that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BY <hi>Reading</hi> here I underſtand reading the ſole word of God: and this as it ſhould conſtantly (for the main at leaſt, if not ever) have a place in my daily devotions in private; ſo therein, me-thinks, will moſt conveniently take place in the beginning of them, on this wiſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing entered into my <hi>Cloſet</hi> for my devotions ſake, it becomes me firſt in all humility and out of the fear of God, not out of cuſtome, to fall
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:33295:33"/> down before him, and in ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to former direction to beg his bleſsing upon me and preſence with me there preſenting my ſelf to worſhip before his majeſty: To which purpoſe the Form <note n="*" place="margin">Part. 1. Chap. 3.</note> already delivered may be proper either for uſe, or further direction, according as I ſhall ſee ſit. This being done, forthwith let me apply my ſelf to the reading ſoine portion of the word, according to my prefixed courſe. And what courſe ſhall that be?</p>
               <p>Modeſty would preſently anſwer, The ſame which the wiſdome of the Church hath preſcribed for publick uſe. And the truth is (the Church conſulting herein, as ſhe ought, the edification of the people.) this order hath, in this point, the advantage of all other, that it will lead us to read over all the moſt uſefull parts of Scripture and thoſe moſt frequently: to wit, the New Teſtament except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely ſome Chapters of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> three times a year; the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:33295:33"/> 
                  <hi>Pſalmes</hi> once a month; the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament (excepting onely the two books of <hi>Chroni les,</hi> which are for the moſt part extant in the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſome other Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of other books, cheifly relating to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſtate) once in a year. But then if we conſider its complyance with our preſent deſigne, it hath theſe two exceptions lying againſt it. Firſt, that the portions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by that order to be read daily, are greater than what every mans or moſt mens conveniency will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford time to read, and meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is (ſuppoſed at preſent) beſt for a devout Chriſtian to do. And then Secondly, that by this means a conſiderable part of the <hi>Old</hi> Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſome part of the <hi>New</hi> will be left out; which parts are not queſtionleſs without their uſe, though, comparitively, not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the publick commonalty as the other. And to the Churches preſcription it may be ſaid, that it was never the Churches intention
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33295:34"/> to preſcribe this order for mens <hi>Cloſets</hi> in private, where ſhe can neither take notice of their obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor neglecting it, but onely for publick edification and uniformity.</p>
               <p>This order therefore being taken not to be ſo proper for our preſent purpoſe, the next which will offer it, ſelf will be the natural order of the books in which they lye. Now this, though not liable to the exceptions, which we found againſt the former (being that nothing then will be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, nor the Reader over burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with too great a portion, being he is left to himſelf) yet hath this inconveniency, that it will detain the obſerver of it a great while in thoſe parts of Scripture, which may not edifie him ſo much, as would the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo that haply <hi>Reading</hi> ſhall be a duller and leſſe ſpiritual an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, than it would be, did he more wiſely order it. Yet hath it this advantage alſo, that the <hi>Revelations</hi> of God and eternal life being ſtill clearer in each ſucceeding part of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33295:34"/> Scripture (I mean clearer in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> than in the <hi>Law</hi> and in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> than in either) one months reading may make me ſee more into that of the former month, and all lead me to the magnifiing of God for the preſent manifeſt revelation of his will.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being ſo, it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conduce moſt to our private edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication if we keep ſtrictly to neither of theſe orders, but obſerving the conveniences and inconveniences of each to our private purpoſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Chriſtian diſcretion frame to our ſelves one out of both, which may have the commodities of both, and incommodity of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And that may be ſuch as this: To begin every Reading with a <hi>Pſalm,</hi> or, where the <hi>Pſalms</hi> are very long, with a good portion of one, taking the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in their courſe: (This I therefore commend, by reaſon of the exceeding uſefull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> for prayer, it furniſhing a man with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33295:35"/> petitions, hymnes and ejaculations of all ſorts, and beſides diſcovering very much of the hearty practice of <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Godlineſſe.</hi> ) That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſht, in the morning to take in order as the books and Chapters lye, ſuch a portion of the <hi>Old</hi> Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as my Chriſtian prudence, conſidering my own conveniences and occaſions, ſhall judge fit: which, where the matter affords more work for <hi>Meditation,</hi> may be ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, where leſs, larger. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at evening, beginning with a like portion of the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> take a part of the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament, as it lyes in order, greater of leſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as beforeſaid, it findes my devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion work. Some ſuch courſe as this would I obſerve, till I had read over the <hi>Holy</hi> Scripture twice or thrice with ſuch care, attention and meditation, as ſhall preſently be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; by which time I ſhould begin to be a little verſt in it, and to know what parts of Scripture I uſed to read with greateſt Chriſtian
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33295:35"/> advantage, which therfore after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I would read oftener than the other; ſetting alwaies a mark at the name of each book, as they ſtand in the <hi>Table</hi> at the beginning of my Bible, when I had read that book o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that ſo I might know how often I had read each, leſt I come too long to neglect the reading of any. This as to the <hi>Order</hi> of my <hi>Reading.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having now my work thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly before me, it remains in the next place that I look to the beſt <hi>manner</hi> of doing it: whither belong the following rules.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that I endeavour to read with compoſedneſſe of mind and attention, not onely to the ſenſe, ſubſtance, or ſubject matter of what I read, but as to the very expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it. For that the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Scripture are not onely very uſefull in prayer (God loving to hear his children call upon him in his own language) but do alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times carry in them ſuch ſecret emphaſes and force, as ſhall much
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:33295:36"/> comfort ſupport, aw, and otherwiſe affect the heart which conſiders them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that I be ſure, as I read, to obſerve the ſcope and drift of the portion of Scripture, which I read. For as to particular paſſages, it may ſo happen, that the plain reader may many times ſcarce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, they puzling ever learned heads: but as to the ſco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap> ſo much benefit as I have underſtood of it, but will give eſpecial light unto thoſe darker places, whoſe meaning I do not ſo well conceive.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That if ever I inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this part of my devotion, to wit my <hi>Reading,</hi> ſhould be acceptable to God, or otherwiſe than a witneſſe againſt my ſelf, I reſolve upon the impartiall practice of what ſoever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Meditation</hi> here I take not for the ſimple thinking of any thing divine, which ſhall offer it ſelf, but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33295:37"/> for an orderly and ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the particulars following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Upon that portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which I have read.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Upon the prayers (that is, confeſſions petitions and thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) which I am preſently to offer up unto God.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt there are theſe three things for me to conſider.</p>
               <p>Frſt, If I have not, as I read, been able to underſtand the deſign and drift of the <hi>Holy</hi> Ghoſt in what I have read, let me conſider touching that: and, by a ſhort reveiw of it, comparing the parts or ſeveral mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials ſpoken of, and attending how they hang together, endeavour to comprehend their ſubſtance and ſcope. He reads to no purpoſe who reads not thus; for it is not repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words of Scripture, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and digeſting their ſenſe and ſubſtance, which is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted reading the Scripture: and one Chapter thus read is worth ten haſtily run over.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:33295:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Secondly, If there be in what I have read any difficult or harder place, which ſeems to contain any matter of practice or article of faith (I mean which is likely to inſtruct me in any thing neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or done in order to my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that let me conſider, and endeavour thereof to find the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As to thoſe difficulties, which concern controverſies, that is queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable opinions in divinity, or inquiries into matters of meer knowledge or ſpeculation, (ſuch things, which when they are known there is no end of them) theſe may be very well overlooked by an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary perſon. As for inſtance; Reading <hi>Acts. 13,</hi> (the laſt Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph or partition of the Chapter, which begins <hi>verſ. 44.)</hi> I find therein <hi>(viz. verſ. 48.)</hi> a certain difficult expreſsion, <hi>As many as were ordained unto life believed.</hi> What <hi>believing</hi> and what <hi>life</hi> (ie, heaven and bleſſedneſſe) mean I know: but what <hi>ordained</hi> unto <hi>life</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:33295:38"/> means, I doubt; and truly need not much trouble my ſelf to inquire. Sufficient it is that I conclude from thence, that <hi>all they who ſhall obtain everlaſting life are believers,</hi> not one unbelieving or ungodly perſon ſhall ever enter into heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore particularly that I reſolve upon an honeſt cordial receiving of the Goſpell, as my duty, if ever I intend for happineſſe. Again, Reading <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus. 32.</hi> I find that <hi>Moſes took the Calfe they had made and burned it is the fire and grownd it to powder:</hi> Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the burning gold in the fire, which onely purifies it ordinarily, ſhould come to make it friable or brittle, that it might be grownd unto pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I need not ſtand to inquire. A ſhorter and better way it is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the matter feaſible, and this relation true, as being part of Gods word: all I need to conclude thence is, that Idolatry is to be deſtroyed, and that in ſuch ſort as the people may not return to it again, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loath and abominate it, as we
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:33295:38"/> do that which paſſeth through our bodies: and that it is the wiſdom of Magiſtrates, whom it concerns to deſtroy it, as it was <hi>Moſes</hi>'s, to find out and contrive ſuch waies or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of deſtroying it. This is I ſay as much as can concern any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary perſon, and as for the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity touched it may ſafely be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. We give not rules to make a Divine but to direct a Chriſtian. Now all ſuch difficulties and curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being left out, I preſume the difficulties, which ariſe in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable matters will be but few. And for my help herein, it will be meet I reflect upon that which (according to the former rule) I found to be the ſcope or drift of that Scripture, and conſider the difficulty with ſome relation or regard thereto, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the occaſion, upon which that expreſſion came in. This will help me very much many times. But for my further help therein, if I am able, it would be expedient I had ſome ſhort gloſſe, or book explaining
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:33295:39"/> ſuch matters: and truly what book to pitch upon, as beſt in this caſe, is not eaſy to reſolve. For I ſuppoſe there are not many books of notes or commentaries upon the whole Bible in Engliſh, which meddle one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with neceſſary and practicable matters, omitting controverſals, which a private Chriſtian, to his better edification, may well ſpare, For the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament I much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire Dr. <hi>Hammons</hi> Paraphraſe, and could ten thouſand times wiſh ſuch a piece were extant upon the whole. But yet it is too difficult for every plain reader. <hi>Biſhop Hall</hi> hath a Paraphraſe upon the whole Bible, which comes much necrer to our preſent deſigne: But I fear this is ſcarce. The frequenteſt, beſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocenteſt that I know is <hi>Diodates Annotations:</hi> they have indeed a <hi>Geneva tang</hi> now and then, but pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſoberly. Some ſuch book ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as I can gett, I would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh my ſelf with, which I might conſult touching the meaning of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:33295:39"/> ſuch difficult places as my Chriſtian direction ſhould tell me to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall, and for my neceſſary edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Having thus found out the deſign of that whole portion of Scripture which I have read, and the meaning of ſuch particular Texts as I ſhall have occaſion to ſearch into, let me in my meditations caſt over again, or recollect the ſubſtance of it, and conſider, what am I the better for the reading hereof?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Am I inſtructed or further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in any matter of faith?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Am I taught any duty which before I either was ignorant of, or neglected? Do I here find any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or command which I never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took notice of, or had forgot, &amp;c?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is there any thing which may quicken me to any duty, in which I am ſlack, or deter me from any ſin to which I am prone? Any threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Gods wrath? Any example of his judgments? Any promiſe of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:33295:40"/> mercy? Any inſtance of bleſſings on his diligent ſervants?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is there any thing which may ſtrengthen me in any temptation, comfort me in any affliction, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt? &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Is there any particular empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical or affectionate ſpeech which may at any time quicken me? Any proper petition, confeſſion, invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thankſgiving or the like, which may be of uſe to me in prayer, or otherwiſe?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Is there any thing which I can obſerve of the experiences of holy men of old? any thing of the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſin? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Through ſuch heads as theſe may my meditations briefly run: which heads till I am perfect in, it may not be amiſs to open this my book and examine what I have read according to theſe directions laid down. And if I am able, I ſhall find it an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefit, in the end of theſe my meditations to uſe my pen, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever by any reading I have gained
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:33295:40"/> any more remarkable benefit, and to regiſter in one of my paper books (reſerved ever for this purpoſe, which I may account my <hi>Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all)</hi> that particular which I have gained: in which I need to obſerve no other method, but onely to write all the notes which I take out of any one book, as of <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> &amp;c. together, that ſo at my ſecond or third reading that particular book over, I may ſee, what the ſecond or third reading of it advantaged me more than the firſt. And theſe notes thus taken, becauſe intended as helps to my memory, I muſt be ſure to find time within a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſeaſon to review. This is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable courſe for me to obſerve in my ordinary meditations upon the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The next thing which my medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be imployed upon, is upon my particular <hi>State and Waies,</hi> which I am in ſome meaſure to take notice of, as well that I may be more circumſpect in ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:33295:41"/> wherein I ſhall find greater need of circumſpection, as that I may be able to addreſs my ſelf to God in a way ſuitable to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. For my condition varying, my prayers ought to vary accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, As to my <hi>Waies;</hi> Let me conſider what new temptations have befallen me, whether as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſins, ſuch which are acted in the mind, or as to ſuch which are matter of outward and bodily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; how far my heart hath cloſed with them, and been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by them? And this is to be laid open before God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As to my preſent <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtate,</hi> the temper of my mind: Let me examine that; whether I find any relentings or meltings of heart for thoſe my wandrings, which I have before viewed, any firmneſs and reſolution for the future againſt the like: Accordingly I am to apply my ſelf to God, either for the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me a due ſenſe of, and remorſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33295:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> for, and reſolution and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs againſt my ſin, or for the heightning and ſtrengthning thoſe degrees hereof, which I already have.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As to my <hi>Outward ſtate;</hi> Let me conſider, how Gods holy providence hath either favoured or croſſed my ordinary affairs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes: for accordingly ſtill I am to addreſs my ſelf unto God in prayer; either by praiſing him for my ſucceſſes, or bewailing thoſe ſins and omiſſions which I may judge have blaſted them, or otherwiſe, as my Chriſtian diſcretion ſhall ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt.</p>
               <p>The laſt head, upon which my meditations are to be imployed is my <hi>Prayers,</hi> which I am now about to offer up unto God: in which if I uſe a ſet form, I am to conſider; where thoſe new particulars of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, petition, or praiſes muſt come in, after what ſort they be conveniently expreſſed, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (when my condition requires
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33295:42"/> and my time will permit me to be more large or earneſt in any part of prayer) with what arguments I may ſtrengthen my faith, and plead with God touching what I deſire to ſpeed for; or again with what cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of my ſins, or Gods mercies I may heighten my repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for my ſins, or thankfulneſs for thoſe mercies. If I do not uſe my ſelf to a ſet form, then will it be neceſſary that I more deliberately meditate what I intend to confeſs, to ask, to praiſe God for, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſhall ſo call upon him or conceive of him, as may ſuit with thoſe main and principal addreſſes, which I am to make to him. Whether every particular expreſſion, or the juſt words be forethought, it haply mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not very much: but that ſome fit ſignificant proper and quickning expreſſions, for the ſeveral parts and ſubſtantials of my prayer, be prepared, it is expedient; as well for the greater readineſs of the ſoul in prayer, which when it is much to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33295:42"/> ſeek in this caſe, cannot do its duty with attention, nor without diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance and intermiſsion of due affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as alſo that nothing unworthy of the nature of prayer, and the worſhip of God, may be offered up unto him. And in this point it may be ſingularly helpfull to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what of thoſe expreſsions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, narratives, experiences, &amp;c. which <hi>I</hi> have at any time read in the Word of God may be uſeful to me in thoſe my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded addreſſes to the Throne of grace. God (as already intimated) loves to hear his own language from us; and ſo it is, that the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Scripture have a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous affecting power upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout heart, beyond thoſe, which ſeem not to have been alike ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the holy Ghoſt uſing them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Now Prayer is the ſeeking unto God, and before him repreſenting our Eſtates and Deſires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The general nature of prayer is a betaking or addreſsing our ſelves to God: and therefore its firſt act is <hi>Invocation</hi> or calling upon him. Now our condition, who are <hi>duſt</hi> &amp; <hi>aſhes</hi> &amp; his Majeſty being conſidered,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:33295:43"/> we cannot well be eſteemed to ſeek unto him without adoration or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping of him in the beginning of theſe our addreſſes; for that in all ſeeking to Superiours we ever begin with ſome acknowledgments of their being above us, able to help us, &amp;c. upon which accounts we uſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſome teſtimonies of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards them. If we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put both theſe together, we have the firſt part of <hi>Prayer</hi> to wit, <hi>An invocatory adoration of God,</hi> that is, <hi>an humble calling upon him,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Worſhipping and adoring his infinite Majeſty.</hi> And this in moſt compleat prayers extant is Scripture we may obſerve: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in that for ever to be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced pattern, our Lords prayer, the firſt ſentence contains what we ſpeake of. <hi>[Our Father:</hi> this is a calling upon God. <hi>which art in Heaven;</hi> theſe are words befitting one who adores his Majeſty.] So in that prayer of <hi>Hezekiah, I ſaiah</hi> xxxvii. 16. <hi>O Lord of Hoſts, God</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:33295:44"/> 
                  <hi>of Iſrael, that dwelleſt between the Cherubims: thou art God, even thou alone,</hi> &amp;c. How evidently doth this beginning of his prayer carry in it a calling upon God, accompanied with the acknowledgement and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of his Deity. The firſt part of prayer we gathered out of thoſe words (expreſſing its general nature) it is a ſeeking unto God. The ſecond we may gather out of them, which follow, it is a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our eſtate before him. Our eſtates naturally are ſinful and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. SO far forth as we retain any thing of our old nature, ſo far are ſin and miſery inſeparable adjuncts or attendants unto us. The repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting therefore our eſtates before God, is the confeſsing our ſins, and laying open our grievances and wants before him. A ſecond part of prayer then is <hi>Confeſſion</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which all ſinners ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is pardon: that which all miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſons do naturally deſire is help. The repreſenting then our
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:33295:44"/> deſires before God is the <hi>begging mercy and grace to help in time of need;</hi> that is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Pardon of ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Deliverance from our miſery. Internal, by the ſanctification of our hearts. Externall, by meet ſupplies of our outward wants.</p>
               <p>A third act of prayer therefore is, <hi>Petition of Asking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Somewhat more yet is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in our ſtates here below, which though naturally miſerable, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, yet are by the manifold grace of God made in ſeveral reſpects more comfortable, by reaſon of variety of bleſsings. Now he that receives a benefit ought to have at the leaſt a will and deſire of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. He therefore who duely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents his ſtate and deſires unto God, laies open alſo before him thoſe ſeveral mercies which at his hands he receives, humbly bleſsing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:33295:45"/> and praiſing him the author of them. The laſt part of prayer then is <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now becauſe all theſe may be done either for our ſelves or others, therefore is prayer double, or of two ſorts.</p>
               <p>That which meerly reſpects our ſelves.</p>
               <p>That which we offer up for others, called <hi>Interceſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all this it is evident, that the firſt thing, which he, who would learn to pray, muſt take care of, is, that he throughly know himſelf, that is, (1. ) Be acquainted with his own ſtate, with his ſins, his miſeries and wants, inward and outward: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he can never duly repreſent them unto God. (2. ) That he well know his own deſires and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, leſt he play the hypocrite with God, <hi>asking</hi> what he deſireth not, or <hi>vowing</hi> what he intends not. Theſe are the ſubſtantials of prayer.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe manner of the performing every duty is much looked upon by God. Now prayer being ſuch an immediate act of worſhip, and it being moſt juſt, reaſonable, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that we ſhould worſhip God with the whole man, that is, both with ſoul and body, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of prayer there can be onely conſiderable, its Inward and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part.</p>
               <p>The inward manner of prayer is unqueſtionably moſt reſpected by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:33295:46"/> God: for that according hereunto is the prayer, and the man, ſincere or otherwiſe. And the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof ſhould incite us cheifly to care herein. I may pray in as good &amp; as many words, in as devout poſtures, and, in a word, after as pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a ſort, as to what there is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in prayer, as ever man did, and yet he hypocritical in my prayers. But it is impoſsible, that I ſhould pray with my <hi>Soul and all that is within me,</hi> and not be cordial, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ſincere in thoſe prayers which I ſo make. And therefore as God doth, ſo, I ſay, every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought to look cheifly to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſpoſition of his ſoul in his <hi>Devotions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may note further for our quickening herein, that God not onely requireth the heart in prayer, but hath accepted and often doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the inward breathings of it, and anſwer them as fully, as if all other circumſtances belonging to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward manner of prayer had been
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33295:46"/> obſerved. As in the caſe of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah;</hi> who in that ſo ſucceſsfull and effectual prayer of hers <hi>spaks in her heart onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now prayer is then right as to its inward manner, when there is an hearty excerciſe of Chriſtian graces and affections ſuitable to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the prayer, which we offer up to God. (That is to ſay, to go through the parts of prayer.) <hi>I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore and call upon God as I ought,</hi> when in my calling upon him, I really believe that he is, and that he is ſuch as he hath revealed himſelf to be and as I now expreſſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, and therefore with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence humbly ſubmit my ſelf before his majeſty. It is a piece of holy skill worthy taking notice of, which is obſervable in the prayers of holy men in Scripture. They uſually ſo frame their invocations or callings upon God, as may ſuit with their main buſineſs at the throne of grace, and ſtrenghthen their faith for thoſe particular mercies which they aske.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33295:47"/> Thus in that ſorenamed prayer of <hi>Hezechias</hi>'s againſt the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Armies. <hi>O Lord of hoſts</hi> [for he prayed againſt a mighty hoſt, and for deliverance from it.] <hi>God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> [he therefore ſo cals God to put him in mind of his covenant with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he might ſtretch forth his hand for the deliverance of his own people] <hi>who dwelleſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Cherubims</hi> [that is, who haſt here recorded thy name and promiſed to meet and bleſſe <hi>and from thy mercy Seat</hi> to anſwer thy people. He therefore makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods promiſed preſence, or <hi>dwelling</hi> between the Cherubims, that he might prevail with God to ſave that City, where his Temple and this his mercy Seat was placed.] Every expreſsion in this his invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath ſomewhat in it proper to his ſuit, and of force to ſtrengthen his faith and dependance upon God, that he might the more ſurely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. In ſhort then the graces to be exerciſed <hi>in adoration</hi> or <hi>calling</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:33295:47"/> 
                  <hi>upon God</hi> cheifly are, <hi>Faith, Fear</hi> or <hi>Reverence</hi> of God, and <hi>Humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I then confeſſe my ſelf to God as I ought when with hearty ſorrow and repentance (which if earneſt will be accompanied with a kind of indignation againſt my ſelf) I lay open impartially my ſins before him, not ſparing the ſweeteſt or cloſeſt: and with an humble ſenſe of my own vileneſſe, impotency and emptineſſe acknowledg my wants or his juſt judgments upon me for any of my ſins. So that the chief grace to be exerciſed peculiarly in confeſſion is repentance or Godly ſorrow, an humble and tender ſenſe of what we confeſſe, accompanied with ſhame of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Further, then I aske as I ought, when, as ſenſible of mine own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe, out of an humble truſt in God, through the merits of his Son, (which truſt his gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and declarations of good will through him, by me ever had reſpect to, do encourage me to take up)
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33295:48"/> I heartily deſire what I aske at his hands: or at leaſt am heartily ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if I cannot ſay I heartily deſire all I aske. Now becauſe while I am asking, it ſo cometh to paſſe, that I often intermix ſomewhat of vow, as in asking the pardon of ſome paſt ſins, many times I engage to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and watchfull oppoſition for the future againſt them, therefore is it neceſſary that, if I would ask aright, I ask with reſolution and purpoſe of endeavouring a new life. And further for that I cannot expect forgiveneſſe from God, except I forgive from my heart my brethren, therefore I muſt ask in charity. So then the Graces cheifly to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in Petition are, Firſt, <hi>Faith</hi> or an humble truſt and hope in God through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that I ſhall ſpeed (which is, moſt truly <hi>Praying in his name)</hi> Secondly <hi>Love</hi> towards God and holineſſe. Thirdly, a ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt <hi>purpoſe of obedience,</hi> which is the moſt conſiderable part of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

               <p>Laſtly, I then praiſe or give God thanks for his mercies as I ought, when I have an inward acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement and ſenſe that it is him alone, and through his meer ſavour, that I enjoy theſe mercies, and when, not onely I my ſelf do admire, but deſire that heaven and earth may admire him for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: when alſo I do all this with a reſolution of improving the mercy given, that is of walking as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh one, who hath been vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed of ſuch a bleſſing. So that the graces to be exerciſed in thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving chiefly are, 1. <hi>Humility,</hi> or a ſenſe of our own unworthineſs, and of Gods free mercy and grace, the onely fountain of all received or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for benefits. 2. <hi>Love,</hi> or an adminiſtration of his goodneſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a deſire that he may receive all poſsible glory for it. 3. <hi>Reſolution</hi> and <hi>ſtudy</hi> of greater and more ſuitable <hi>obedience</hi> and duty to him:</p>
               <p>Theſe are thoſe graces, in the

               </head>
               <p>IN the outward manner of prayer the chief points conſiderable are,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:33295:49"/> the uſe of ſit poſtures, and meet words.</p>
               <p>Now though the poſture of the body ſeem to be a ſmall matter, yet methinks my prayers wants their due ſolemnity, if not performed in a poſture of worſhip. True it is, many a devout prayer a man may make riding upon his horſe back, walking in the fields, and the like: and right Chriſtian is it thus to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie my neceſſary journies, or the time which otherwiſe would be wholy loſt in travel, or ſtoln away by ſuch recreatory obambulation. But theſe are occaſional, and not my ſet and ſolemn devotions. Here my body being otherwiſe neceſſarily imployed, the moſt which I can give to God is my ſoul: or if to my thoughts my words be added, it is as much as well can be. But in my fixt courſe of devotion, it is not to be ſuppoſed that I worſhip God <hi>(aliud agens)</hi> imployed with any thing but his worſhip: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore herein let my body, as well as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:33295:50"/> my ſoul, be taken up in meet acts of worſhip. Now that I account to be the beſt poſture of worſhip, which beſt expreſſeth an inward reverence of that Majeſty, to whom I addreſs my ſelf, who having <hi>fearfully made</hi> my body, and to this day <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> upheld and preſerved it, and (which is infinitely more) redeemed even my very body to immortality by the body and bloud of his Son, hath obliged it, as well as my ſoul, to all poſsible homage. And it is to be obſerved, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to ſpeak (chiefly if not only) of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and his daily devotion, when he ſaith, <hi>I bow my knees to the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> What was his therefore, let it be my practice, as often as I thus pray, to bow my knees: and (if to no other end, but that I may be ſure to mind, that they be <hi>without wrath)</hi> let me add the <hi>lifting up of hands.</hi> Other poſtures may be ſometimes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in our ſolemn humiliations, or more earneſt deprecations of any
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:33295:50"/> imminent evil; ſuch as is <hi>Proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or caſting my ſelf on the earth before God: to which pious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion will eaſily in their ſeaſon direct.</p>
               <p>As to matter of words or the forms of prayer, this age hath ſeen more controverſie, and that in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> alone, than all ages from the beginning of the world have known all the world over. Touching which matter I ſay onely, that the nature of prayer being, as beforeſaid, a <hi>ſeeking unto God by way of adoration, confeſſion, petition, and praiſe,</hi> if we do this with honeſt hearts and ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able affections, whether the words in which we utter our ſelves, be our own or anothers; whether they he forethought or ſudden, (provided they fitly and reverently expreſs the inward ſenſe of our hearts) it mattereth not, nor is it at all eſſential unto <hi>Prayer.</hi> For the full eſſence of prayer is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, ſuch an addreſs being made inwardly by my ſoul, and outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33295:51"/> thus expreſſed by my tongue and body: and be the words whoſe they will, my praying them (that is, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them up to God) with an heart ſuitable to them, hath made them as much mine, as if I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, contrived, dictated or pend them at the firſt. I think therefore, if men would be ſober and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably minded, this need not make ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſtirre in the World, or move any ſcruple to a Chriſtians conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>I profeſs my ſelf no whit guilty of undervaluing the free effuſions of the ſoul before God (in private eſpecially) in ſuch expreſsions as the affected and moved mind ſuggeſts, or as the ſpirit gives utterance. But in my daily private devotions to uſe perpetually ſuch a looſe and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britary way, I think hath theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies Firſt, that (by reaſon ſometimes of the coldneſs, dulneſs, and heedleſneſs of my heart; other times by reaſon of diſtractions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, and the like almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:33295:51"/> miſchiefs) my devotions will be too often ſlightily ſlubberd over, perfunctorily and diſorderly performed: Whereas, had I a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and well compoſed prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, which I uſe wholy to offer up to God, all would be much more ſubſtantial: and though haply my heart may have been in theſe my prayers too too dead (as it was likely perhaps to have been, had I prayed otherwiſe, for ſuch or ſuch a ſeaſon) yet ſhall I not prove guilty of ſuch idleneſs, negligence, and ſlightineſs, as otherwiſe I ſhould have been. And ſuch infirmities, which are incident to us by reaſon of our preſent frailty and ſtate, God is likely the more eaſily to pitty and paſs by, when he ſees that, though we are more indiſpoſed than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, yet are we no whit leſs dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. Secondly, Another inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience thereby may oftentimes be, The omiſsion of many things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be confeſſed, asked, or returned thanks for; not ſo much
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:33295:52"/> through negligence, dulneſs, &amp;c. (as before) as incogitancy and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable forgetfulneſs. Our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wants and ſpiritual concerns we may come not to mind, either at all, or as we ought, through much being intent on ſome other preſsing (outward) evils. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience will eaſily ſatisfie a Chriſtian herein, who is but verſt in the practice of what we ſpeak of. Have I not many times kneeled down before God with an intention to ask ſuch things which by reaſon of my earneſt asking ſomewhat elſe, I have forgotten to ask before I aroſe? and hath not the reaſon been the meer following extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſuggeſtions? Let it it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>Again, on the other ſide, to uſe alwaies a certain and conſtant form of words, ſeems to have theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies. Firſt, that we having almoſt daily new ſins to confeſs, new wants to beg a ſupply of; theſe by ſuch courſe ſhall be omitted, or only
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33295:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> lightly and generally toucht, at leaſt not ſo particularly and affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſſed and inſiſted upon as they ought. 2. Beſides, ſometimes haply I would ſpend more time in prayer than at another time: Now if my prayers be alwaies the ſame, I cannot, expect (as Papiſts are reported to do their <hi>Credoes and Ave Maries)</hi> I ſhould run over and over the ſame again. 3. Further, frequent uſe may breed dulneſs, as ſome may think.</p>
               <p>Theſe being the inconveniencies of both caſes, and each caſe beſides having advocates (or perſons that love and plead for them) even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the common people, it will be beſt to move for an <hi>Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation:</hi> And that may be on this wiſe.</p>
               <p>The inconveniencies of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer caſe may be avoided, by the having a certain good plain and full form of prayer, which we well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and by uſually tying our ſelves hereto: not ſo as, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:33295:53"/> our work is done by the prayer being ſaid; for that were to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the moſt neceſſary part in the manner of prayer, contrary to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rule: nor ſo, 2. as not to alter, for this or that time, any expreſsion as God may move our hearts in prayer, or inſert any new thing as we have need: but only ſo, 1. as to enſure my ſelf that my devotions and prayers be ſound and compleat, that I offer not to God the <hi>halt and the lame:</hi> ſo, 2. as to keep my mind fixt and conſtant to its buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, intent upon all its ſpiritual concerns.</p>
               <p>And again, the inconveniencies of the later caſe will be avoided hereby, that we have not ſuppoſed the form upon occaſion altogether unalterable, as above ſaid, but rathen to have its fit and proper places, wherein we may inſert or put in the confeſsion of new ſins, with their proper aggravations, as alſo fit places for the adding of any new matter of <hi>Petition</hi> or <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:33295:53"/> as there ſhall be occaſion. And to the laſt inconvenience of this ſecond caſe, it may be ſaid, that Uſe cannot beget dulneſs, if the prayer thus ſuppoſed to be framed, be uſed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to former precepts, with <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Meditation</hi> before it, which exerciſes will have in a good meaſure quickned the heart for prayer. And as for ſuch more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſeaſons, when we would ſpend more time with God in prayer, we need not ſo to tie our ſelves to theſe our ordinary devotions; thoſe, which at ſuch ſeaſons we intend, being already ſuppoſed more than ordinary. We may be larger in the confeſsion of ſin, more particular in its aggravation, more earneſt for ſuch and ſuch mercies as we want, &amp;c. according as we ſhall ſee occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and either uſe the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work and ſubſtance of thoſe our uſual prayers, with ſuch amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as we ſhall judge meeteſt, or for that time, in ſtead of them, uſe ſuch other prayers as we ſhall find
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33295:54"/> beſt to ſuit with our temper and occaſions; for the preparation of which prayers directions will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be given.</p>
               <p>In the mean time for better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and comprehending the precepts given, as alſo for the ſupply of ſuch who may haply be ſcarce able to frame to themſelves ſuch a form, it may not be amiſs to ſubjoyn one for morning, and another for evening, framed according to the former rules.</p>

Wherefore let him yield himſelf to the leading of the Spirit, and by no means let ſlip that holy ſeaſon of a more free and large effuſion or pouring out of his ſoul before God: Alwayes in the mean while remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that he duly prepare himſelf, by ſomefore going meditation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what hath been already in part ſpoken, and will hereafter be more fully conſidered.</p>
               <p>And this practice, I preſume, as it ſo far binds a man up, that his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall not be looſe and ſlighty, ſo it allows him (1.) ſuch liberty as may duly exerciſe and improve any ſpiritual gifts which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf to have, and (2.) ſuch variety as that there is no fear, that cuſtome or treading alwayes the

               <p>If there be any Objection now lying againſt this propoſed courſe in our devotion, it is, as far as I can ſee, onely this, that it will take up too much time. But we have already ſuppoſed our practiſt to be ſuch, who lives ſomewhat above a ſervile life, and therefore may ſpare ſome part of his time, which ſurely he cannot ſpend to a better purpoſe, or upon more beneficial employment. And it will undoubtedly be ſound true by him, who ſhall ſet himſelf upon this practice, or put his devotions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this mold, that when he is once but got into the way, and ſettled in it, the performance of all will coſt him leſs time by much in a day, than hath the reading of theſe directions. An hour in a day (or very little more) being divided into equal parts, and half taken in the morning, half at night, may very well ſuffice: and they are either very full of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,

               <p>It is as uncharitable as unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a part, to conclude, that becauſe they bear the name ordinarily of certain Saints and Martyrs, that therefore the daies were ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſecrated to the meer ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of thoſe Saints. The deſign of the Church in this inſtitution ſeems to me only thus much.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that Almighty God might have particular glory for all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular parts and degrees of the work of our redemption (the Incarnation, Circumciſion, Paſſion, Reſurrection, &amp;c. of our Saviour) as likewiſe for all thoſe his ſervants by whoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and examples, whether in life or death, his holy Goſpel hath been planted and confirmed. Then 2. that there might be due comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of ſuch particular perſons,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:33295:69" rendition="simple:additions"/> and of the graces in which they did excell; as well to the end, that their examples (at leaſt) might be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal incitement to vertue, and they being dead might yet thus ſpeak; as that vertue might have its deſerved honour, which, for the enforcement of like worthy practices upon others, comes not at all too late though it be given to the aſhes of the vertuous.</p>
               <p>And that theſe two, to wit, Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing particular honour to God, and the Propagation of vertue, were the main aims of the Church, ſeems to be undeniable, if we do conſider either the particular Collects on thoſe daies, or that clauſe in the Primmer <hi>for the Eſtate of Chriſts Church Militant,</hi> towards the end <hi>[We bleſs thy name for all thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants departed this life in thy faith and fear, beſeeching thee to giue us, grace to follow their good examples,</hi> &amp;c.] which prayer, we know, is one part of the Service of the Church upon every Feſtival, and both this
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:33295:70"/> and the formentioned Collects ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly proſeſs as much as we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.</p>
               <p>Now theſe, as they cannot be rejected by any ſober men (and ſo the end being right, and the power juſt, and the thing it ſelf as juſt (which two laſt, becauſe I ſee no reaſon for the queſtioning them, I let paſs without any other proof, than the evidence which they carry with them) it cannot be ſeen how the inſtitution ſhould be amiſs, wherefore the factious have an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:) ſo they are directly fruſtrated by thoſe, who look upon Feſtivals as meerly a time of liberty, and ſo many daies devoted to pleaſure or idleneſs. I will not ſay, but that both the Church and State, in ſetling their inſtitutions by Law, might have ſome aime at allowing ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and thoſe who live a ſervile life, ſome reſt and time for lawful recreations, which ſometimes the covetouſneſs of ſome Maſters, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſome perſons own covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:33295:70"/> would not allow them: (And this is juſtifiable even by the practiſe of God himſelf in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>that thy ſervant may reſt,</hi> &amp;c.) but that it was never either the Churches or States inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they ſhould wholy be ſpent to this purpoſe I do affirm; and for proof hereof, <hi>at home,</hi> alledge our Laws, which enjoyn all on ſuch daies to reſort to places of publick worſhip for the ſervice of God, and <hi>abroad,</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mperial Conſtitution, <hi>We will not that Holydaies, which are conſecrate to the ſupreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, be imployed or ſpent upon plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi> And it would be a right pious work, and as much for the vindication of Feſtivals as any other, if Magiſtrates would according as I am ſure they may, puniſh thoſe, who uſe to ſpend whole Holydaies in their pleaſures (dauncing, hunting, runnings, footballs, &amp;c.) by the legal mulct for abſence from Divine Service.</p>
               <p>But may no recreation then be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:33295:71"/> taken upon Holydaies? I do not ſay, nor intend that: nor doth, I preſume, the Law, neither new, or old. But the reſt and (if by the reſt we will underſtand any thing but a dull idleneſs) the refreſhment of labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring perſons, being one thing which, by the way, was deſigned in their inſtitution, plain it is that lawful recreations as they are exerciſes of refreſhment, may on them be uſed. But as to ſuch recreations, which ſhall ſupplant or thruſt out the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, which is the main end to which the Feſtivals were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I ſee not how they can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin be frequented, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or tolerated: I am ſure our Eccleſiaſtical Laws tolerate them not.</p>
               <p>Further, I preſume the genuine ſenſe of the fourth Commandement enforceth as much as I preſs: For that enjoyning a Jew to ſanctifie the ſeventh day, that is the time which by their Law was ſet apart to the worſhip of God, will alſo (at leaſt)
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:33295:71"/> in equity and reaſon enjoyn a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to ſanctifie ſuch times, as their Laws have conſecrated to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip: which Laws touching the particular ſetting apart of times to the worſhip of God, though they are not all extant in Scripture, nor immediately delivered by the mouth of God; yet, being made by them, whom he, to whom <hi>all power both in Heaven and Earth was given,</hi> hath commiſſionated and made his dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates (to wit, his Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſours, the governours of the Church) cannot be looked upon as altogether humane, but have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſtamp of Divinity; according as ordinarily we interpret the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Kings officers, in ſuch things wherein they are commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, to be the Kings commands. Now, that Holydaies were ordained by the lawful governours of the Church, is too evident to be denied. And I ſhould not fear to ſay, that ſome of our preſent Feaſts were at the leaſt obſerved by ſome of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:33295:72"/> Apoſtles, our Saviours immediate Subſtitutes. How therefore can we neglect to ſanctifie ſuch times, which are thus confecrated to God, that is, not imploy them to thoſe ſeparate uſes, to which they were appointed (which is the meaning of ſanctifying, in this regard, in Scripture) without the unhallowing <hi>holy</hi> or <hi>devoted</hi> things, or withour the evident breach of this Commandement.</p>
               <p>I will add no more to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, bnt that every one being bound to proportion his time for his devotion, according to the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities and leiſure which he hath, and it being unlawful by the very municipal law or law of the Land (for ſuch is the Eccleſiaſtical law in this caſe) totally to follow the work of my calliug on Feſtivals or Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, I cannot but have more lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on them for the ſervice of God; and therefore conſequently a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter portion of it is to be ſpent in my devotions. Which being concluded, as moſt lawfully and rightfully it
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:33295:72"/> may, in general, what hath been ſaid holds as well concerning private as publick devotions. I ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to think my ſelf bound on every Holyday to ſomewhat more of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in private, than what every day calls for.</p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:33295:74"/> not onely in reſpect of his Divine nature, as he is the expreſs Image of his Fathers perſon, but alſo as he is God man, as having been born in our nature, <hi>and purged our ſins, he ſate down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high.</hi> So that the very humane nature of our Saviour, how ever contemptible it might ſeem once to be, is now advanced infinitely above the <hi>Angels, all the Angels being to worſhip the incarnate Son of God, and his Throne being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there being in all this no conſiderable matter of difficulty which offers its ſelf, I have no need here to apply my ſecond rules (tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſearching into difficulties) and therefore I proceed to the third, to conſider what I am the better for having read this. The ſubſtance of it I have already gathered in the practice of my firſt rule: that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewing, to gain light to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular parts, I find by the ſecond verſe my ſelf inſtructed and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:33295:75"/> in that point of my <hi>faith,</hi> the <hi>Eternity of the ſecond perſon,</hi> or the Sons being from everlaſting: For it is ſaid <hi>that God by his Son made the Worlds,</hi> that is (as I may probably conclude) all things that are. His Son then was before the <hi>Worlds,</hi> that is from Eternity.</p>
               <p>Again that admirable expreſſion <hi>[the brightneſs of the fathers glory, and expreſs image of his perſon and the upholder of all things by his power]</hi> what a glorious repreſentation is it of the Sons <hi>Deity,</hi> and <hi>being</hi> diſtinct, but not ſeparate, from his eternal father; according as the brightneſs of glory may be conceived as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from that glory of which it is the brightneſs, but never can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from that glory.</p>
               <p>Again that following expreſſion <hi>[after he had by himſelf purged our ſins, Sat down at the right hand of the Majeſty on high]</hi> with what an heavenly emphaſis doth it ſet out.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The fullneſs of the atonement
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:33295:75"/> made by Chriſt as to every faithfull perſon: by himſelf he purged our ſins: and how can they not be pure before the father whoſe ſins his only Son by himſelf hath purged?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The tranſcendency of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours glorifycation <hi>[He ſat down at the right hand of the Majeſty on high]</hi> What a bleſſed (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or) <hi>height</hi> is here to expreſs it! and how doth the very expreſſion affect the conſidering mind! <hi>he ſat down at the right,</hi> &amp;c. me thinks I could ſay it an hundred times over with new admiration and diſſolution of ſoul. It ſecretly inſinuates alſo, what ſhall be our future glory, when we ſhal be like unto him, and <hi>ſit down with him at the right hand of the ſame Majeſty.</hi> More of the ſame nature might be noted, but this is ſufficient to exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie the Rules.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to conſider the Goſpel which alſo I am ſuppoſed to have read. [Goſpel, <hi>John 1.</hi> v. 1, to 15.] The ſcope and ſubſtance of this Goſpel ſeems to be this, that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:33295:76"/> our Lord Jeſus being God ever with the Father, in time took upon him our nature to redeem us, and that <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was a witneſs hereof.</p>
               <p>But here are ſeveral expreſſions, which ſeem to contain ſome matter of faith touching our Saviour, and yet I do not perfectly underſtand them. Wherefore if I have any help (as before directed to, by the ſecond Rule touching Meditation upon Scripture) I conſult that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this whole portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Which having conſulted I may be ſuppoſed in ſome tolerable meaſure to underſtand what is held forth therein neceſſary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. If I have no ſuch book or help, then I muſt make as good ſhift as I can: and conſidering the ſcope and drift of the place before mentioned, and every particular expreſſion at which I ſtick, I interpret that which I doubt of, with a regard to, and by the height I can take from, what I underſtand. Thus having
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:33295:76"/> the general ſcope of this Scripture in my mind, I review it, or conſider it again in the order as it lies. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing do I meet with which I do not in a good meaſure underſtand till I come to v. 4, &amp; 5. (For having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at the firſt reading, that (v. 14.) the Apoſtle ſaith the <hi>Word was made fleſh,</hi> by the <hi>Word</hi> in the 1. verſe I can underſtand nothing but the eternal Son of God) In <hi>him was life, and the life was the light of men.</hi> What life? or how is the life the light of men? I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the holy Ghoſt is here ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Delty of the Son, and in the third verſe aſcribes the making of all things to him. Then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows <hi>In him was life.</hi> It is very likely that the meaning hereof is thus much. <hi>He is the fountain of life,</hi> he made as well the things which live, as thoſe which do not. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated life to all living <hi>And the life was the light of men.</hi> It is very likely that life here is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of that natural life, which all
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:33295:77"/> men whatſoever live: for he ſpeaks of Chriſt as the Creator of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Now, whereas it is ſaid, that this <hi>life is the light of men,</hi> or that that life, which men do partake of from God, is light, haply the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hereof may be, that the life, which the Creatour gave to man, was a more light ſome, that is a more intelligent, life than what the reſt of living creatures here below par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of; to wit, a Rational life. Now it follows, <hi>The light ſhined in darkneſs, and the darkneſs compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it not</hi> It is very likely that by <hi>light</hi> I muſt underſtand in this verſe what I did thereby in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to wit, Reaſon: and ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all more attently, at length I gueſs, that ſome ſuch thing as this is the import of that verſe.</p>
               <p>The natural light of mans reaſon ſhone in his corrupt and ſenſual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but that Nature followed not the dictates of it: Men rejected what their reaſon would have guided them to chooſe. And this, being
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:33295:77"/> that I was led thereto by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the drift of the words, and find now that the words will, to my beſt judgment, very well bear, I conceive may probably be the meaning of this place. But here it may be very neceſſary to admoniſh (eſpecially ordinary people) that they proceed not too far upon their own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in interpreting darker places of Scripture, of which this haply may ſeem one. We have only in what we have ſaid ſhewn the beſt way, which can be taken for the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out the ſenſe of Scripture. But if ſo be, that uſing this method I particularly could not have found out ſo much touching the ſenſe of this Scripture, as hath been above decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet had not either my reading or my meditation been fruitleſs. I could very well and very profitably have reſted in this, that I obſerved theſe verſes to teſtifie to me, that Chriſt is God, and by him all things were made: and that from him came life, and all the light, which in life
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:33295:78"/> men have. And thus much, by obſervation, a plain perſon might have found from hence. But uſually plain perſons will do beſt, not to truſt the ſtrength of their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which commonly is none of the beſt judge of conſequences and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances, but rather get to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch helps as above directed to, and follow their wholſome gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</p>
               <p>Well: having found, out as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thus much of the meaning of this Scripture, if there be any thing elſe I doubt of in that part of it which remains I proceed to conſider it, carrying ſtill in my mind the ſcope of the whole, and thus much as I have learnt of the ſenſe of the former part. The ſubſtance of the remaining part ſeems to me thus much, That when it pleaſed the <hi>Word to be made fleſh</hi> (that is, the Son of God to take upon him our nature, and in that nature to dwel) <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was ſent for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to teſtifie, that this was the <hi>true</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:33295:78"/> 
                  <hi>true light,</hi> to the end that <hi>men</hi> might believe: And to as many of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as did believe upon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this light, this light (himſelf being the eternal and natural Son of God, gave the priviledge, right or power to become through him the Sons of God being now born unto a new <hi>(viz</hi> a godly) life by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him Now here it may be (as I look through the particular verſes) are one or two things more of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which! doubt of, and touching which I will conſult the beſt helps I have, or, otherwiſe conſider with as much attention and modeſty as I can.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in what ſenſe ſhould Chriſt be termed the <hi>true light?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This conſidering of, I remember that before, there was mention of a, certain <hi>light</hi> which all men did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take from the <hi>Word</hi> as created by him (to wit, their Reaſon) and this light, though it ſhone in them, yet (as the firſt man did not follow its ſhine ſo) the reſt did reject his gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:33295:79"/> and the <hi>darkneſs received,</hi> or <hi>comprehended it not.</hi> But now it is ſaid, <hi>that the Word;</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſt made fleſh,</hi> is <hi>the true light:</hi> both which conſidering together, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of all ſeems to be this, That whereas the natural light of reaſon, being not comprehended (but rather overcome) by the darkneſs of mans corrupt nature, was inſufficient, of it ſelf, to lead man unto his ſalvation or true happineſs, and, being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticated by the ſame corruption, had led him to ſeek happineſs in many falſe and by paths. Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to bring to light the true way to happineſs, and ſo was the <hi>true light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence alſo I begin to ſee ſomewhat into the ſecond paſſage which I doubted of, to wit, what ſhould be the meaning of that <hi>[as many as received him].</hi> For, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how the Evangeliſt in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes immediately foregoing ſpeaks of Chriſt, to wit, as the <hi>true light,</hi> I eaſily ſee, that to receive him is to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:33295:79"/> embrace him as the light, and ſo to apply my ſelf to thoſe holy waies, which he hath diſcovered, alone to lead unto happineſs. Which alſo the following words further intimate <hi>[them that believe in his name]</hi> that is them, who by their imbracing the diſcovery, which he hath made, and doing accordingly, do manifeſt that they are perſwaded he is the true light: which thing they do not as they are born by <hi>the will of man,</hi> of fleſh and bloud (for the <hi>darkneſs comprehendeth not the light)</hi> but as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, or created over again by God hereto.</p>
               <p>So then, now I conceive I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Goſpel for this day,</hi> and all the moſt concerning particulars in it. The ſubſtance of it therefore I recollect after this my ſearch, to the end it may ſink the deeper into me, and I be the better verſt hereafter in this Scripture. And that is this. That Chriſt, being eternally God, was alſo with God (with whom he ever was) the Creator of all things:
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:33295:80"/> and particularly of man: that man in his creation received a certain light <hi>(viz</hi> his reaſon) which he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and overcome, rather than followed: that therefore it pleaſed Chriſt to be made man, and coming into the world, to diſcover the true way to happineſs unto degenerate man, and as many of mankind, who embraced this diſcovery, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted their belief of Chriſts being the <hi>true light,</hi> by their receiving him as ſuch, he reſtored into the bleſſed ſtate of being the Sons of God (as <hi>Adam</hi> was before his fall). And <note place="margin">Luke 3. 38.</note> of all this <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was ſent before to be a witneſs, that by his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony men might be prepared to believe in this <hi>true light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much then I am improved in point of knowledge. But is there nothing which may be further uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me as to practicals? No pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of mercy? No threat of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to any? Nothing to quicken me to my duty? There is ſurely.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:33295:80"/>
               <p>Firſt, that is a remarkable expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>As many as received him, to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m he gave power to become the ſons of God.</hi> I cannot expect ever to be by my incarnate Lord, made a Son of God, and Heir with him in the Kingdome of his Father, except I receive him as the <hi>true</hi> light, except I look for happineſs by the method by him delivered, a holy Chriſtian practice, according to his Goſpel. I ſee therefore hence the neceſſity of heing conformable to all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Goſpel. He is ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to none to whom he is not light: If therefore I am not faithful, meek, charitable, holy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Goſpel directs, ſalvation it ſelf will not ſave me</p>
               <p>Further, both the Epiſtle and Goſpel put me in mind of, what the day celebrates, the incarnation of our Saviour (at leaſt his viſible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, for to the eye he was not incarnate till born.) <hi>The Word was made fleſh,</hi> and ſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſpake unto us, <hi>and by himſelf be</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:33295:81"/> 
                  <hi>purged our ſins. The Word,</hi> who was that? <hi>The Son of God, the brightneſs of his Fathers glory, the expreſs Image of his Perſon, he who was ever with God, and ever God, heir of all things, by whom aell things were made, he was made ſleſh. O ths depth of the love of God and Chriſt!</hi> Whoſe ſoul can well hold to contemplate it!</p>
               <p>Beſides this admiration, and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ſoul, the thoughts hereof cannot but be thus further uſeful to me.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſeeing, from what an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite glory, to what a mean nature and condition, the Son of God (himſelf the infinite God) ſtooped for the help and ſaving of men, I cannot but ſee my ſelf in duty bound to the like humility, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and condeſcenſion; not to ſtand upon mine own petty intereſts, and conſult nothing but ſelf, when I have opportunity to do good to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fcriour, that wants my ſuccour. Had Chriſt done ſo, he had never been
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:33295:81"/> made fleſh for me. Now <hi>let the ſame mind be in me which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again, ſeeing to what an height of excellency the nature of mankind is now advanced, it ſhould prevail with me to put a due price upon it, and never willingly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, by any unworthy action, what God himſelf hath ſo honoured. Did God ſtoop to vindicate my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the contempt and tyranny of the devil, and ſhall I, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the condeſcenſions of his grace, ſtill wilfully enſlave and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Further, God having united the nature, of which I am a partner, to him, I ſhould be ambitious of all meanes of uniting my ſelf to him, that is, of doing all that may be on my part to further this union.</p>
               <p>And eſpecially, the thoughts hereof ſhould quicken me this day to a zealous participating his body and bloud. Can I conſider God made fleſh for me, God debaſing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:33295:82"/> himſelf to be one with me, and is it poſſible that I can neglect, what is ſo much for my honour and intereſt, as the means of ſealing my particular union with him? How can I eſteem my ſelf doly to have celebrated the memory of his being made fleſh, if having means of partaking of that fleſh, which he took, I neglect it? And how much ingratitude muſt ſuch neglect have in it?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſeeing that one great end of our Saviours being incarnate was. to be the true light to man in the pur ſuit of his happineſs, let me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a noble degree of aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or being like my Saviour, if I can in any meaſure be a light to any herein. And if God have by office made me ſuch, let me prize and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour my imployment: and manifeſt my value of it by my diligence in it. The more light I give, the nearer do I in my office come unto my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>Thus much then of incitement have I hence. to my duty. My other
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:33295:82"/> rules are not here ſo applicable: Wherefore in the concluſion of my Maditations I conſider what of new all that <hi>I</hi> have meditated, doth ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt <note place="margin">See Part. 11 ch. 5.</note> unto this dayes prayers: And that <hi>I</hi> ſhall find to be matter of As to the firſt,</p>

               <p>St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> the firſt of thoſe who were to paſs to Heaven in the fiery Chariot of a violent death, for the witneſs of Jeſus, was now as good as ſentenced: for the defence, which he had made, had onely further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed his perſecutors. But he, who ſhould take firſt ſo bold a ſtep, had need of ſome more than ordinary encouragement: It pleaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, whoſe Witneſs he was, to command away the Clouds, and through the opened Heavens to ſhew himſelf ſtanding at the right hand of God, ready to receive him thither. And ſeeing the paſſage now ſo clear, and the end ſo glorious, it was not likely that good <hi>Stephen</hi> ſhould ſtumble at a ſtone or two. <hi>This method doth the gracious provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God obſerve, that where he gives a bitterer cup, there he ſecretly</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:33295:86"/> 
                  <hi>provides greater encouragements,</hi> and thereby raiſeth the ſtrength of his ſuffering ſervants.</p>
               <p>Anſwerable to his encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do <hi>I</hi> find St. <hi>Stephens</hi> carriage. For being caſt out of the City, and ſtoned, all is ſo far from daunting him, that it ſcarce ſeems to have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed him; for he readily prayes to his Saviour both in his own and his murtherers behalf. Particularly, theſe Virtues <hi>I</hi> cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve livelily ſhining in him ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>1. Conſtancy, Reſolution and Chriſtian Magnanimity in thoſe ſufferings, which a truly Chriſtian cauſe engaged him in. 2. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his extraordinary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of glory (Chriſt witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to him from Heaven in that bleſſed Viſion) perſeverance in earneſt prayer to the laſt, When the ſtones now ſtruck him, he called upon God and ſaid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs, patience and ſerenity: The injuſtice of his ſufferings exaſperates
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:33295:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> not his Spirit, nor puts him into any paſſion or indiſpoſition for his duty 4. Meekneſs, Charity, Forgiveneſs, even towards them, who in that they were enemies to him, were enemies alſo to Chriſt. He <hi>kneeled down</hi> [An expreſsion of the ſolemnity of his Prayers] <hi>and cried with a loud voice</hi> [an expreſſion of the earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fervour of them.] A pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern moſt worthy imitation in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>A double benefit then the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this portion of Scripture (recollected according to direction) <note place="margin">Part. 11. Chap. 5.</note> yields to me. The firſt, an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote or Remedy againſt dejection under, and ſlaviſh fear of ſuffering. If God at any time call me to the bearing a greater weight of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than ordinary, let not me baſely or ſinfully decline them, but rather remember what St. <hi>Stephen</hi> (and indeed all the Children of God have) found by experience, that ſtrength ſhall be given in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably, and that ſuitable to my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:33295:87"/> ſhall comfort and refreſhment come in to ſuſtain my ſpirit, if I nobly engage. Secondly, St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>'s example is to me a copy how I ought to ſuffer. Hence ſhould I tranſcribe, Conſtancy, Dutifulneſs, Patience, Charity, and what ever other Virtues I can obſerve him to have exerciſed in his ſufferings.</p>
               <p>Now as to particular expreſſions here, that which concludes the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot well paſs without notice. <hi>And when he had ſaid this, he fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep:</hi> In ſweetneſs and love he breathed out his ſoul; and he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, pitty it was, but that to ſo ſweet a ſoul, death it ſelf ſhould be ſweetned, and ſo it was: <hi>He fell a ſleep.</hi> It teacheth me how I am to look on death. To all men death is but a ſleep: good or bad, they muſt awake from it. But a good mans death ſhould be looked upon onely as a falling aſleep, or as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture ſaith, <hi>Reſting from his labours:</hi> Death is much the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to good men</p>

               <p>Of theſe notes or remarks which I have thus in my Meditations on this Reading made, thoſe which I have mind chiefly to faſten upon my ſelf (though I would not forget a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) are theſe, which follow, of which therefore I regiſter in my Memorial ſome hints, perhaps ſo as follows.</p>

               <p>The Goſpel, <hi>Matt. 23. v. 34.</hi> to the end.</p>
               <p>Obſerving the ſcope of this Scripture, I find it to be a Prophecy of the diſmal calamity which ſhould befal the <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

A judgment ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them, which ſhould be in ſome meaſure a proportionable revenge of all the righteous bloud which had been <hi>ſhed, from Abel to Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 35.</note> and this by reaſon that they did perſiſt in ſhedding ſuch righteous bloud, as they indeed did in the caſe of our Saviour, and his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:33295:88"/> followers. Their City there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould become a deſolation, and the very worſhip of God being laid waſt, they ſhould expect the Meſsiah <note place="margin">Ver. 38.</note> ſo long, that they ſhould even bleſs him that could tell them any thing of him.</p>
               <p>This is the general ſubſtance of this Scripture. Difficulty in it I find none to ſtop me: I proceed therefore to inquire what of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage I can make by the reading of it, according to my propoſed courſe. And, 1. I find my ſelf, by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the two firſt verſes of it, much ſatisfied touching one caſe, in which I have many times thought God to deal very hardly, to wit, touching his viſiting the ſins of the fathers upon the children. <hi>Verſe 3 5.</hi> It is ſaid, that upon that generation ſhould fall <hi>all the righteous bloud ſpilt from Abel to Zachary,</hi> which, at the firſt look, ſeems very ſevere. But the reaſon is rendred, <hi>ver. 34.</hi> becauſe, of <hi>the Prophets, wiſe men and ſcribes, which Chriſt ſent amongſt</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:33295:89" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>them, ſome they would kill and eruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, ſome ſcourge in their Synagogues, others perſecute from City to City,</hi> according as their forefathers ever had ſerved the Prophets: Which gives me ground to conclude, <hi>That children ſeldome or never inherit their fathers puniſhments, or the wrath due to their fathers ſins, but where they firſt prove inheritors of thoſe ſins:</hi> And in this caſe, becauſe they have ſeen their fathers ſins, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, which have befallen them for them, and yet not mended by their examples, it is but juſtice, that their fathers ſins ſhould be viſited upon them, that they ſhould have the ſame or like puniſhments as their fathers had, and greater.</p>
               <p>Then, 2. I cannot but note how ſlowly and unwillingly God comes to judgment. Thus much thoſe words, <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem,</hi> ſuggeſt to me. Our Saviour, I ſee, cannot foretell this deſertion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the <hi>Jews</hi> without a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table taken up, <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:33295:89"/> So unwilling is he to puniſh that he even weeps at the very thoughts of it. [This is a very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting conſideration, and of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial force to quicken me to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and is therefore to be noted to that purpoſe.]</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Examining further accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules propoſed, whether there be no inſtance of Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt ſinners, no threat to deterre me from any ſin, or the like, I find there is, and cannot but ſtay my thoughts a while upon this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy denunciation of woe againſt thoſe, who were outwardly Gods own people, for their rejecting the offers of grace, and upon fooliſh prejudices not acknowledging, or not being willing to ſee the light, which yet they could not but ſee. <hi>And if God ſpared not the natural branches, how much leſs will he ſpare me, who am onely grafted in out of the wild olive, if I be guilty of the ſame ſin?</hi> It concernes me therefore in this caſe to look into my ſelf: the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:33295:90"/> very reading of this Scripture ought to be to me a warning And let me ſee: Am I not guilty of the like reſiſting light and rejecting grace? What do I elſe when I ſin preſumptuouſly, and onely not <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully?</hi> Do not I then ſhut mine eyes againſt the light, and offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the convictions, which come from thoſe Scriptures, whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, the <hi>Jews,</hi> were rejected, for offering violence unto? They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected their living teſtimony, I not onely that (for that I have in the Scripture) but the very voice of their bloud, by which they ſealed the truth of their teſtimony. Oh ſinful and ungracious wretch!</p>
               <p>Now if any ſuch as this be my caſe, let my meditations here reſt a while. Let me conſider whether in this Scripture, which hath thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me of ſin, there be not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which may reclaim me. And truly there is 1. (That which hath already been mentioned) Gods unwillingneſs to puniſh, his
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:33295:90"/> patience and forbearance. And hath not this been great towards me? How often have the warm offers of love and pardon invited me, as they did them! May not I ſay, God would have many a time <hi>gathered me under his wings?</hi> And do not theſe very warnings, that if <hi>I</hi> am not reclaimed, <hi>I</hi> muſt be forſaken, ſpeak Gods preſent unwillingneſs (if any thing will work) to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me? Is not this as much as an <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem?</hi> Again, 2. <hi>I</hi> here ſee, that though God bore long with his people, he would not bear alwayes, being that they did perſiſt in reſiſtance of his Grace. And truly <hi>I</hi> know not how ſoon God may call home from me his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Spirit, and, ſuffering his Grace no longer to be abuſed, leave me as he did the <hi>Jews,</hi> in my own ſtubbornneſs and wilfulneſs to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</p>
               <p>After this ſort may <hi>I</hi> employ a while my thoughts: and if time will ſuffer, thus ough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if any neceſſary matter force me to depart my privacy, before my meditations arive at ſuch a ripeneſs, yet let me not fail to take notice of the warning which <hi>I</hi> received and ſet it down in my Accomptal, that ſo upon my * faſting day, when <hi>I</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view the actions of that week, <hi>I</hi> may be ſure not to forget it, but to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my ſelf for my former miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and conſider for the future, how <hi>I</hi> may turn my feet into new wayes.</p>

               <p>1. For grace, that I may from henceforth yield unto all motions of Gods holy Spirit. 2.

Whether to diſtribute it in money, or in that which is bought with my money, may be more ſuitable to the wants of thoſe whom I relieve, a little Chriſtian diſcretion will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily direct. And the more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this practice, let me conſider how naked, miſerable and ſtingy ſolemn thankſgiving is, without ſomewhat of Almes giving. Then ſurely I rejoyce in a way moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the mercies I and mankind have received, when as many as I have wherewithall coveniently to help, have cauſe to rejoyce for my

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:33295:96"/> this propoſed will make me more liberal in theſe my acts of charity: for how can I offer niggardly to this my bountiful God, when I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to my ſelf, I have ſomewhat conſiderable, if I will well husband all; which I may devote to him, &amp; yet not abridge my ſelf or mine either of neceſſaries or conveniencies: and hereto I ſhall be the more quickned if I remember I offer to God, who both gave me, and ſees all I have. Now whether I may upon ſuch a day meet with opportunity to my mind; or ſuch a perſon to beſtow it on, as the diſcretion of my charity could wiſh, or whether I cannot; yet let me account it really given to God, and therefore ſeparate it from the reſt of the ſtore, ſo that ever after I may look upon it as devote, and not to be touched, except to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to the poor. But if any fatal neceſſity ſhould conſtrain the meddling with any part of ought thus ſeparated, let me religiouſly obſerve to return it again to the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:33295:96"/> poor mans purſe or ſtock, with an expiatory uſury; that is with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, which may make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for my firſt diminiſhing it. And thus we will leave the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate devotions of Feſtivals, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, in the next place, what will be meet to be performed on the Lords day.</p>

               <p>TOuching the obſervation of the Lords day, though I judge them indiſcreet friends unto it, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the inſtitution of it mainly to the fourth Commandement, yet I put the keeping of it holy ſo far out of all queſtion, that I cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him very unchriſtian, who either is ſlightly herein himſelf, or
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:33295:97"/> goes about to poſſeſs others that they may be ſo without ſin.</p>
               <p>The 1. naturall juſtice of the <note place="margin">The true gro 3nds of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fying the Lords nay ſum. med up. 1 Cor. 16 1, 2.</note> thing, that there ſhould be ſome time ſet apart amongſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an community for the publick and ſolemn worſhip of God, 2. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity and authority of that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick canon (recorded partly in expreſs terms in Scripture, and if it were not ſufficiently manifeſt by their practice) which hath ſet apart this time, 3. Our Saviours honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this day with his reſurrection thereupon (which gave occaſion to its being ſet apart) 4. The cuſtom of all Chriſtian Churches through all ages, and from the very Apoſtles daies. 5. Nay the practice of our Lord himſelf on this day meeting his aſſembled Diſciples, are all of them arguments beyond contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <hi>warrant</hi> (ſufficiently) divine, that it is to be eſteemed conſecrate or ſet apart to the worſhip of God. And then the force which the fourth Commandement in equity bears,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:33295:97"/> that what time is ſet apart or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to God ſhould be ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is ſpent to thoſe ſeparate purpoſes and intents, for which it was ſet apart (which I ſay is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſanctifying or keeping holy any time) ſufficiently and beyond all evaſion enjoyns its being kept holy, it being ſuppoſed once to be ſet apart, as it is before proved to have been. And certainly (if as is undeniable, it be the duty of every Chriſtian, as much as may be, to keep all his life as a perpetual Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batiſm <note place="margin">Hebr. 4. 10.</note> or holy reſt unto God) it muſt needs be an argument of a very profane, worldly, and unchriſtian ſpirit, not to afford God this day free from ſenſual pleaſures, and worldly cares or labours. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſay, the keeping holy of the Lords day, I put out of all queſtion, and would have no man flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he is a devout Chriſtian, who uſeth either by idleneſs or pleaſures, or unneceſſary worldly buſineſs to profane what ( the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:33295:98"/> Church, and being that the Church hath done it, by good warrant and power tranſmitted to her by Chriſt) God himſelf hath allowed. Profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation I call it: for if the ſpending it to holy purpoſes be to ſanctifie it, then the ſpending it contrarily upon ordinary or unworthy practices, is to profane it. And if we may not <hi>give that which is holy unto dogs,</hi> it is then ſurely moſt intolerable to take that time, which by divine Law ought to be holy unto God, and give it to his enemies, the devil, this world, and our own luſts, which we do when we ſpend the Lords day either in idleneſs, pleaſures, or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs worldly matters.</p>
               <p>Works of charity or mercy are acts of holineſs: and works of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, ſo far forth as they are works of neceſſity, are acts of mercy, and conſequently the doing of either of theſe (that is, works of <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>Neceſſity)</hi> when due occaſion calls me thereto, is rather ſanctifying than unhallowing the Lords day)
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:33295:98"/> (eſpecially if I do them out of duty towards God, and in his fear) and for this I have his warrant, who tels <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 13.</note> me that he better accepts <hi>Mercy than Sacrifice.</hi>

               <p>SEeing then that the Lords day is to be kept holy, that is, to be ſpent in the worſhip and ſervice of God, for which it is ſet apart, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns me to conſider how I may ſpend it in a way moſt complying with this its deſign or intendment. And I ſhall eaſily, upon the very conſideration of the nature of Gods worſhip, be convinced, that it is in a manner impoſſible for me duely to ſanctifie it, if I come unto it hot and wreaking from my worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:33295:99"/> For being I am to worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth, with all my mind, ſoul and ſtrength, and in a word with my whole man, evident it is that I am unable ſo to do, while my heart yet remains unemptied of the world: and being unfit to worſhip God, I am not, while ſo, in a due ſtate to ſanctifie this day. Wherefore the right ſanctification of the Lords day is to begin with Preparation.</p>
               <p>And it is a right wholſome inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that upon the Evening before it, there ſhould be Prayers in every Pariſh Church, which is grown now too much into diſuſe by reaſon onely (that I can imagine) of the degeneracy of the age. If there be ſuch cuſtome kept up in my Pariſh, I would not, but upon neceſſity, be abſent from thoſe preparatory prayers: At which, though I ſhould be ſuppoſed to have been preſent, yet would I not content my ſelf therewith: but, whether I have been imployed publickly in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:33295:99"/> or not, in my courſe of devotion, on Saturday night, take ſo much more time than I do ordinarily, as might ſerve for ſome preparatory Meditations and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>The leaſt which I can do to this purpoſe in my Meditations, is, Firſt, To examine whether there be not ſome ſin or ſad miſcarriage of the week paſt, which lies unrepented of, and ſo may blaſt my next daies performances. And if any there be, ſecondly, to conſider of it more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, its aggravations, its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whether it be not ſuch an one, part of the <hi>Repentance,</hi> for which muſt be <hi>Reconciliation, Reſtitution,</hi> or ſomewhat like: and accordingly to apply my ſelf to what <hi>I</hi> in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and in the fear of God do judge due repentance. Thirdly, to endeavour the emptying my head of worldly (at leaſt diſtracting) cares; to bid them be gone now, till a day for them return: And laſtly, ſo to contrive (as neer as <hi>I</hi> can) all my
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:33295:100"/> affairs for the next day, that both <hi>I</hi> and my family may have as little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, or matters to call away our minds from holy duties as may be. This by way of Meditation.</p>
               <p>My Prayers muſt be ſuitable to my condition. If any ſuch ſin, as before mentioned, be found, that muſt be confeſſed, bewailed, and pardon craved, together with grace for the future againſt it: which may be done by putting in the mention of that ſin in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>ſpace</hi> left for ſuch purpoſe. But beſides this, it will be neceſſary to add, ſome particular petitions for due preparation or diſpoſition of heart for the duties of the next day. Firſt, for a quiet, ſetled, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed mind ſo that <hi>I</hi> may attend, with all my ſoul, my holy concerns or buſineſs. Secondly, for enlive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned affections, that <hi>I</hi> may not be dull and heartleſs, but of a tender and melting ſpirit. Thirdly, for a pliable ductile yielding and eaſie mind, that <hi>I</hi> may mix the word with
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:33295:100"/> faith, and render the obedience of faith. Laſtly, becauſe both my own and the Congregations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and edification much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Miniſters due and affectionate diſcharge of his office, it is therefore fit <hi>I</hi> forget not him, but commend him to the aſſiſtance of the Spirit. To which purpoſe the following prayer may be either inſerted in ſome fit place towards the end of my prayers or added to them.</p>
               <p>O Lord from whom the preparations of the heart are: The day now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth which, being holy unto thee, I am to ſpend in thy more ſolemn worſhip. Many ſins there are by me not due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repented of, which may juſtly bring upon me a curſe inſtead of a bleſſing. [Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

But accept thou I beſeech thee of this my confeſſion of them, and (at leaſt deſired) ſorrow for them. Turn my heart from them for the future: and through the bloud of my Saviour ſo remove the guilt of them, that they may not hinder good things from me. Let the effuſions of thy grace both upon me and all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of thy people be plentifull. Let my heart be fixed, and none either vain or worldly thoughts lodge within me this night. Quicken me by thy Holy Spirit, that I may draw neer unto thee
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:33295:101"/> with a true heart, and be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in Spirit in thy ſervice; and with a good and honeſt heart receiving thy word, may underſtand and keep it, and bring forth fruit with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and unto perfection. Remember thou thy ſervants who are to diſpenſe thy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries unto thy people: and eſpecially him upon whoſe teaching I am to wait. Pardon their ſins and frailties; Open their mouths, guide their minds and tongues, that they may deliver thy truths in the demonſtration of thy Spirit: and let thy work ſo proſper in their hands, that both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others may be built up in our moſt holy faith, to the perfecting thy Church, and the eternal glory of thy

                  <p>Firſt then, as upon no day we

And ſuppoſing the publick ſervice to begin generally about nine of the clock, between ſix and ſeven will be a good hour: and all things being well ordered may conſiſt very well with moſt mens health and occaſions, And of this time, which paſſeth between my riſing and going to Church, if an hour and the odd parts be divided between the devotions of the family and the cloſet, ſo that half an hour be ſpent in the one, and the other half with the odd time in my cloſet, it may do very well; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon occaſions of moſt houſes being conſidered, ſo much time may be
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:33295:103" rendition="simple:additions"/> allowed: If ſo much cannot be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to this work, yet let ſome; and what day ſoever I ſpend with double prayers (I mean prayer in my cloſet, and prayer in my family) yet this day let me omit neither. It is a bad <hi>omen</hi> to begin the ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords day by the breach of my ordinary courſe of devotion, and an argument it is likely to be but negligently ſanctified by me.

                  <p>Now if queſtion be made what the devotions of the family are to conſiſt of, the anſwer is, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well conſiſt of more or leſs

                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>Reading</hi> here I underſtand chiefly the reading of the Word of God: and that it is the duty of the head of the family, either himſelf to read, or cauſe by ſome other to be read, the holy Scriptures in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the family; none can queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who conſiders thoſe frequent Commands to the ancient people of God, to <hi>teach their children the Law of God, and his judgments,</hi> and deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 9. &amp;c.</note> with them.</p>
                  <p>Now how they can be taught thoſe things by their parents, from whom they never hear of them, cannot be underſtood: nor will any reaſonable perſon think thefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands fulfilled by the meer teaching their children the <hi>Belief, Lords prayer,</hi> and <hi>ten. Commandements</hi> (though this muſt be moſt ſure to be done) for we find of old they were to acquaint their children of Gods wonderful works in delivering them <hi>out of the Land of Egypt:</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:33295:105"/> And in like manner we Chriſtians to teach our children Gods Miracles of grace, in freeing us by his Son out of the bondage of ſin; which, how it can be better done, than as God hath thought fit to teach it to the world, to wit, by the Holy Scriptures, none will eaſily find out.</p>
                  <p>Now for the method to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in reading the Scriptures in our family, that which was above com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for uſe in the Cloſet may haply be moſt proper. And if <hi>I</hi> ſo order it, that <hi>I</hi> read the ſame portion of Scripture in my family, and in my cloſet, it may be much for my edification: the double reading it will ſet it deeper, both in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and in my underſtanding. But then, leaſt <hi>I</hi> read faſter and more in my family than in my cloſet, and for other reaſons, it will be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that either my Cloſet devotions go before my Family devotions, or that at leaſt <hi>I</hi> ſo contrive my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that what <hi>I</hi> laſt read in my Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:33295:105"/> I the next time read in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of Meditation, which was one part of my Cloſet devotion, if in my family <hi>I</hi> uſe to examine my people, what they have learnt or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved out of what hath been read; and where none takes notice of what is mainly obſervable, there ſuggeſt it to them, it may not be amiſs, provided it be done ſoberly (without a long deal of prate and medling with curious matters) and without vain-glory.</p>
                  <p>The Prayers which <hi>I</hi> uſe in my family, except upon ſome very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent occaſions, may beſt be the Prayers of the Church. Theſe are eaſie and beſt underſtandable: and the uſe of them in our families, will ſit the plaineſt people in our family to uſe them with more devotion and underſtanding in the publick. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>I</hi> confeſs my judgment in this caſe to be, that the <hi>Injunction</hi> of them doth not in ſtrictneſs reach to private families, but there is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt; yet if we uſe that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty only thus, ſo as freely and of our own accord to prefer the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church, <hi>I</hi> really judge, (generally) it will be the beſt. Some particular caſes there may be, as when any great judgment lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a family, or the like, which may be admitted as exceptions to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule, and in which caſes it may be expedient to uſe either other or more Prayers than thoſe extant in our Church Liturgy.</p>
                  <p>The general courſe then of my family devotions will be this. Firſt, he who prayes begins with the laſt clauſe of that Exhortation thus: <hi>[I pray and beſeech you, as many as, &amp;c.]</hi> Then follows the Confeſſion: <hi>[Almighty and moſt Merciful.]</hi> The Abſolution is to be left out, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be a Miniſter who read. Then comes the Lords Prayer and Verſicles. Which being done, all riſing, give attention to one reading a Pſalm and a Chapter, or ſo much of them as the chief of the family
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:33295:106"/> ſhall appoint. This being ended, if the Maſter of the family, or any by him deputed, will at that time examine, or briefly (as beforeſaid) inſtruct any touching what hath been read, here ſuch examination will moſt ſeaſonably come in: After which, he who reads the prayers ſaying <hi>[Let us pray]</hi> all kneel down, and he begins with the Verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, <hi>O Lord ſhew thy mercy, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo proceeds with the Prayers in their order, as they ſtand, morning and evening.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Lords day in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after the prayer for the Biſhops, Clergy and people, that is juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bleſſing, it may be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to add, for preparing grace unto all, the prayer in the beginning of the Communion ſervice <hi>[Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, to whom, &amp;c.]</hi> (or if there be any ſitter in the Liturgy found) and that at the end of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſervice <hi>[Prevent us, O Lord, in all our doings with,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
                  <p>And in the evening upon the

Having therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly taken my place, <hi>I</hi> ſhould (not out of cuſtom but devotion) how to God my knees, and beg his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence and bleſsing towards me, and the congregation of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ſhall there meet that day, which <hi>I</hi> may do in this or the like form.</p>
                  <p>O Lord, who though thou dwelleſt not in Temples made with hands, yet haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to meet and bleſs thy people wherever thou haſt recorded thy Name; be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be graciouſly preſent to thy ſervant here worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

Pardon every one, who hath not prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf according to the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Sanctuary. Quicken us all for thy Names ſake; teach us to do thy Will, and build us up in our moſt holy faith, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know there are ſome who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt this practice, but I could never yet ſee any reaſon in their pretenſions.</p>
                  <p>This therefore being done, if the Congregation be not yet fully met, it is not for me to employ my ſelf in vain diſcourſe with any of my neighbours: but either to meditate
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:33295:109"/> on ſomewhat which may be ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, or, if I can, to read.</p>
                  <p>And it may not be improper, till I am well verſt in it, and know my duty therein well, to read the Church Liturgy, Rubrick (that is the directions which are mingled with the prayers, for their uſe) and all: taking one day ſome part of it, and another day another, till I have gone through it wholly. By this means, diſcreetly uſed, I ſhall be able mere readily to join with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in the uſe thereof. But if the Congregation be fully met, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice beginning or begun, I am to yield all poſſible attention, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring God requires my whole man, all mine heart, ſoul and mind, yea, and my very body too: Where. fore ſo am <hi>I</hi> to place and order even that <hi>(I</hi> mean my very body) as the worſhip of God, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches inſtructions for the worſhip of that God, require; <hi>kneeling, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and anſwering</hi> ſtill whereſoever <hi>I</hi> ought.

                  <p>During the celebration of Gods worſhip, if my mind at any time be run away from my work, I am, as ſoon as ever <hi>I</hi> perceive it, ſecretly to check my ſelf, to call it home, and in my heart ſay, <hi>Lord pardon and help thy ſervant,</hi> or ſome ſuch thing, and, in a word, to imploy it as fully as <hi>I</hi> can about my buſineſs, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring not onely how diſpleaſing it is
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:33295:110"/> to God, but how unprofitable to my ſelf to draw near unto him with my body onely, and honour him with my lips, when my ſoul is afar off.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever <hi>I</hi> hear of the Word, read or preached, <hi>I</hi> muſt remember all along to apply unto my ſelf: not carping at, or cenſuring the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but taking all in the beſt ſenſe, <hi>(Poſſibly, it may be long of my ſins he did no better, or ſo ill)</hi> nor looking ſo much how it concerns others, as my own particular ſtate and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.

                  <p>The exerciſes of divine worſhip being all ended, <hi>I</hi> am with the ſame

                  <p>My return with my family home ſhould be with the ſame gravity and care, with which was my paſſage to the Church: my talk rather of what <hi>I</hi> heard or learnt, than of any worldly matter, except neceſſary occaſions enforce the contrary. And being come home, one of my firſt
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:33295:111"/> buſineſſes ſhould be to ſtep aſide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Cloſet, if poſsibly <hi>I</hi> can, and there, according as I have found my my ſelf affected, to apply my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.

                  <p>I Bleſs thee, O Lord my God, for the comforts of thy Houſe; for thy awakenings of me to my duty; for any ſoftenings of my heart, and ſenſe of thy love, or hopes of injoying thee hereafter. Not unto me, O Lord, not unto me, who am a vain, hard-hearted, ſinful wretch of my ſelf, but to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:33295:111"/> thy holy Name be the praiſe. Now encreaſe, I beſeech thee, this thy goodneſs to me; and confirm me in thy Grace ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more: Let me grow in the knowledge, fear and love of thee; and any impreſſions thereof, which I have this day received, ſuffer me not to looſe; but enable me to bring forth fruit unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to the glory of thy Name, through Jeſus Chriſt, my bleſſed Lord and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this prayer may not ſuit with my condition, it may be preſumed, that as I have knowledge enough to ſee it doth not, ſo I have abilities enough, in ſome tolerable way, to repreſent and bewail before God my barrenneſs, heedleſneſs, worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, carnality, and whatever other
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:33295:112"/> great diſtempers I find in my ſoul: which accordingly I ought briefly to do. And this being done, let me recollect my ſelf, and view over in my mind thoſe ſeverals, which I have that day learned or been affected with: for this will further imprint them upon my memory. Leſs than a quarter of an hour may ſuffice hereto: and though haply ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I may ſee occaſion to allow more, yet ſo much ſure I may afford at all times.</p>
                  <p>Having thus faſtened upon my ſpirit my ſpiritual gains, I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to my company for the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry refreſhment of my body, which this day was not appointed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge me of. Let me therefore be chearful, and eating my meat in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſs of heart rejoyce before my God: but let not my joy by any means be wanton, idle, vain, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate.</p>
                  <p>Of the reſt of the time which paſſeth between the publick duties of the day, the imployment ought
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:33295:112"/> to be ſacred, at leaſt wholeſome, and ſuch which may not indiſpoſe me for the remaining part of the daies work: and hereof much care is to be had,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As to my diſcourſe: touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, if it be the Apoſtles Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, at all times to be obſerved, that <hi>our ſpeech be alway with grace, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned</hi>

                     <hi>with ſalt,</hi> certainly more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ought it to be ſuch on this day. And though it cannot be accounted abſolutely ſinful to converſe about ſecular matters of concernment, if occaſion ſo require, yet. 1. To be wholly taken up with theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but argue a greater care of this world than ſenſe of Chriſtianity, if ſo be there be any truth in that ſpeech of him who is infallible: <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the</hi>

                     <hi>mouth ſpeaketh</hi> And, 2. To be needleſly meddling with ſuch affairs, or idly buſying our ſelves about other mens actions and concernes (which are the ordinary ſubject of mens diſcourſes after dinner on the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:33295:113"/> Lords day) is at the beſt but a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of worldlineſs and vanity: and it is made the character of naughty men, that <hi>their tongues walk through</hi>

                     <hi>the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to my actions care too is to be taken: It is not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs unlawful upon due occaſion, that is, on account of mine own or others neceſſity, or conſiderable conveniency, to put mine hands to an ordinary action, as is evident <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 9 5.</note> from our Saviours both doctrine and practice: But (as aboveſaid of diſcourſe, ſo now of buſineſs) to be needleſly imployed in worldly matters and ordinary work, cannot but be ſome kind of profanation of the day, as being contrary to its ſanctification, that is, the ſpending it to other uſes and ends, than thoſe for which it was ſet apart. And albeit in this caſe no certain perpetual rule is to be ſet (the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men being various) but each mans Chriſtian diſcretion and piety ought to mete out to himſelf
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:33295:113"/> what he in his own conſcience, and in the fear of God, conſidering his occaſions, judgeth fit (in which we are not one to judge another) notwithſtanding I cannot think that man takes ſuch care of himſelf as he ought, or is duly cautious of indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his heart for his duty, who can conſtantly ſuffer all this time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Morning and Evening ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to paſs over with him without any thing of devotion, either in his privacy or family, or juſt as the ſame time paſſeth over every day. This I ſay, cannot be to ſanctifie the day, becauſe not to ſeparate it from common, and to uſe it to diſtinct ends.</p>
                  <p>Soon therefore after dinner end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt all the family, it is meet that I call the younger ſort and ſet them to the learning their Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme: and as to the Elder, if I ſuſpect any of them to be apt to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle away their time, let them be kept in my preſence; and if all of them be able, let them read, by courſe,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:33295:114"/> ſomewhat out of the Scripture, or ſome plain and honeſt book; if all be not, then ſuch as can.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>MY departure from the Church and my retirement as ſoon as I come home for about a quarter of an hour, or as I ſee occaſion, ſhould
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:33295:115"/> be after the ſame ſort, as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the day. Which being done, it will be expedient to come amongſt my people and ſee that all things are wiſely ordered; that ſo, ſometime before night, the Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the family may be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In the mean time, both <hi>I</hi> my ſelf, and as many of the family as can be ſpared from neceſſary ſervices, are free to our private devotions. Onely if there are any triflers, let them and the younger ſort be dealt with as after dinner, that is, kept, where the people moſt commonly ſit, reading and attending to the Word of God; at leaſt for ſome certain ſpace. Let them not ſpend their time as they do ordinarily: for the Lords day ſhould look with another face than common dayes all the day long.</p>
                  <p>This care being taken of my ſelf and family, <hi>I</hi> ſee not but my Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty permits me any honeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, ſuch as may be walking forth in my garden, in the fields or
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:33295:115"/> open air. Onely let me obſerve theſe cautions 1. That my walk be ſome ſuch as <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Evening walk was, that my Meditations be <note place="margin">Gen. 24. 63.</note> good. Unqueſtionably I ſhall not find the fields an unfit place for good thoughts: There are many in the world, whom the very breathing the free air, the beholding the glorious light of Heaven, the paſſing clouds, the verdant earth and ſmiling face of all things, tranſports into a rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of devotion, affects very much with the admiration of the Creator of all things, makes too long for the time, when either they ſhall aſcend above them all, or ſee them paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and dwell ever with their God, beholding his face without any ſuch interpoſitions. And with much advantage may a man ſpend an hour thus, mixing often prayers or eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations with theſe his thoughts. 2. Another caution <hi>I</hi> ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve is, That <hi>I</hi> return ſo early, as that neither my Devotions in my Cloſet, nor in my family, may be
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:33295:116"/> omitted. And truly moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent will it be, that my own private devotions (which, being that <hi>I</hi> look on my ſelf bound to on other dayes, I cannot this day omit) be performed before that ſupper, which <hi>I</hi> take: for then ſhall <hi>I</hi> be freſheſt; then will what <hi>I</hi> have learnt that day be better in my memory, than after the diverſions which my ſupper and company may cauſe. Beſides that, the performance of them will have fixed and prepared my ſpirit againſt any ſuch diverſions, and for the performance of devotion in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
                  <p>Now as to what <hi>I</hi> am this evening to perform in my Cloſet, it is the ſame, for the moſt part, as at other times. My courſe of reading muſt be the ſame: onely if ſo be that I ſee fit the portion which I read lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. My Meditations, beſides what is every dayes task, upon what I read, may take in a view of my car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage that day; an enquiry what I have learnt; a conſidering it ſo as
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:33295:116"/> to affect my ſelf with it; and a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down a reſolution to endeavour in all my waies a practice of it. My prayers may take in ſome new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, [of my unprofitableneſs, hardheartedneſs, unſetledneſs] pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions [for pardon, <hi>memory to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and grace to perform</hi> what I have learned.] Thankſgivings [for any quicknings of heart, reſolution of holineſs, any inſtruction or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of my Chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, &amp;c] all ſuitable to what in my Meditations I have found mine oſlate to be: for the inſerting or putting in of which, I ſhall eaſily find in my uſual prayers fit places.</p>
                  <p>My Cloſet devotions being thus performed, time it will now be for me and my family to take what Evening meale we uſe: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done in ſome convenient time before we go to bed (which ought not for many reaſons to be too late) if I am a pious Chriſtian I cannot but look upon my ſelf bound to ſhut up the day in my family with
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:33295:117"/> ſome ſuch devotions as I begun it with. Touching which ſome dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions have been already given, as to Reading and Prayer: and it is onely to be added that I am to make ſome enquiry ſeverally into thoſe, who are under my charge, touching their improvements that day; to help out and inſtruct the ignorant; to rebuke, and that ſharply, the negligent and heedleſs; to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the careful as my Chriſtian diſcretion ſhall ſee meet: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt place for which, will be either before the prayers begin, or juſt after the reading of the Scriptures, ſo that the family may be diſmiſſed and the day ended with prayers.</p>

For we may account a man intemperate in his feeding, as well by being too delicate and fine, and eating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly on things which are fit chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for perſons above his degree, as by eating overmuch. Now not all abſtaining from this my lawful food is that <hi>Faſting,</hi> which is here inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: for I may abſtain for my healths ſake, or through buſineſs, or (by ſome accidents) upon neceſſity,

               <p>NOw that none either ſuſpicion touching its neceſſity, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for its neglect may be left, it will be expedient to conſider what Evidence may be brought that Faſting is a Chriſtian duty. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. Indeed there needeth little more to be urged for the proving it a duty, beſides the recollection and ſumming up thoſe excellent ends to which it ſerves and conduceth. No doubt but to humble my ſelf for my ſins, to pray earneſtly for pardon, and for the turning away of Gods wrath are duties; No doubt but to keep under my body and make it ſubject, to relieve the poor, to ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with the <hi>afflictions of Joſeph,</hi> are duties: now to all theſe is faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:33295:121"/> a meanes, and of ſome of them (beſides) an expreſſion. No doubt but to deny my ſelf, and to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſelf an holy revenge for my former extravagancies, are duties: Now of theſe is Faſting a part. It may therefore hence ſufficiently be concluded a duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A further evidence of the ſame I take it to be, that Faſting is <note place="margin">Mat. 62, 6, 15. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> by our Saviour, in that Sermon of his upon the Mount, which delivers to us the ſum of the Chriſtian law, or rule of Evangelical duties, ranked with Prayer and Almes giving; (which are undoubted duties) and reſcued from the Phariſaical abuſes of it, the true manner of it being inſinuated: Inſomuch that it may be juſtly demanded, how comes it to ſtand in the Chriſtian law? to what end needed its practice to be vindicated from corruption, and aſſerted, as it is by Chriſt, to its purity, if it were not a Chriſtian duty? Beſides</p>
               <p n="3">3. We find God in its ſeaſon cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:33295:121"/> for it, of old by his prophet <hi>Joel, Sanctifie a Faſt, call an Aſſembly;</hi> which place though it intend a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faſt, yet it is evident our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <note place="margin">Joel 2. 15</note> in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpoke of thoſe private Faſts, which every one is by him ſuppoſed to conſecrate unto God. Who knows not that the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of the ſoul</hi> (touching which we meet with ſo many commands, and ſuch frequent mention in the old Teſtament) doth mainly intend faſting? And as to the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, further yet: though our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour once tell us, the ſeaſon for his Diſciples faſting was not then come, <hi>while the Bridegroom was with them,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 15</note> yet at the ſame time he tells us, its ſeaſon would not be long too, <hi>and then they ſhould faſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Again, the conſtant ſenſe of the world, and of all the Saints of God in all ages (amongſt whom by how much ſoever any have been more zealous, by ſo much the more hath he been in the exerciſe of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) is an argument (no whit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:33295:122"/> of its being a duty. Not onely the Saints under the Law faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the phariſee too twice a week, but the devout Chriſtians have ever been to us enſamples hereof. And,</p>
               <p n="5">5. (Which ſets it off with more advantage) we find not onely the commendation of them for this practice, but the recompence of it with many ſignal bleſſings recorded in Scripture: which recompence God doth not uſe to give to will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip. Thus we find <hi>Anna</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for her continuing in the Temple day and night, <hi>ſerving God with Faſtings and Prayers.</hi> And it <note place="margin">Luke 2. 36.</note> is obſervable, that <hi>faſting</hi> is there reckoned as one part of her <hi>ſerving God.</hi> That bleſſed viſion, which led <hi>Cornelius</hi> to the knowledge of <note place="margin">Act. 10.</note> Chriſt was vouchſafed to him upon a day when he had faſted till about the ninth hour (which is with us three a clock) and then too we find him not at meat, but prayer.</p>
               <p>All which cannot but enforce that
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:33295:122"/> though it be not alwaies and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly a duty, as is Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Charity, and ſuch others; yet is it as far a duty as any thing can be that is not required abſolutely and for it ſelf: and that therefore whenſoever there is occaſion for it (and no Chriſtian can be long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due occaſions requiring it) it is to be performed; and being ſo, if it ſhould be performed in manner of a free will offering, or oftner than in ſtrictneſs the Chriſtian might ſeem to have need of it, yet if it be done as it ſhould be, it is likely to be acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>But this makes it ſeaſonable to enquire how often a Chriſtian is to faſt.</p>

               <p>IN anſwer whereunto it muſt be ſaid, that no certain or conſtant rule, as to all perſons, can or may be given herein: nor will the times of faſting be the ſame to all, ſome men having more need, others leſs (if not need yet) opportunity. We are aſſured by the ends to which it ſerves, that many mens particular conditions (which haply leave them none other means to mortifie the fleſh but this) make it a duty very neceſſary for them to be much in. On the other ſide, thoſe who ever feed ſparingly and temperately, and have an evener conſtitution, leſs inclined to carnality and inordinate affections, than have other men, ſeem to have leaſt need of this taming diſcipline. And thoſe whoſe labours
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:33295:123"/> are daily and hard, and whoſe life is ſervile, many times neither have ſo much need, nor ſo much opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of faſting, as have thoſe whoſe life is eaſier. Yet foraſmuch as it is (according to what hath been above inſinuated) a piece of <hi>Afflicting a mans ſoul,</hi> and ſo a neceſſary piece of contrition and repentance (which hath commonly ſomewhat of <hi>indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> againſt a mans ſelf in it) there is none who can think himſelf wholy diſpenſed with for it, or to have no need at all of it. But I ſay every mans conſcience and Chriſtian diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion muſt in the fear of God ſet to himſelf the rule, how often he is to faſt: for that every one beſt knows his own needs, and it would be very ſinful in ſome not to uſe more ſtrict and oftner faſtings than others; and ſome on the contrary muſt be very injurious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhould they uſe ſo much faſting, as others (if they duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their leiſure and condition) cannot but think themſelves in duty
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:33295:124"/> bound to. This is the ſum of what in general may be poſitively deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined as to all. Yet it is worthy our conſideration, and may be a guide to particular perſons to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that it is a practice of very great antiquity to <hi>faſt twice a week,</hi> and was in uſe as is evident before our Saviours daies, and by him not cenſured in the Phariſee upon any other account, than becauſe he was proud and conceited of it, uſing to reflect upon it in oftentation of his own holineſs, and ſcorn of others. And it is a very worthy note of St. <hi>Chryſoſtomes,</hi> that we ſhould onely <hi>avoid the Phariſees pride, but not neglect his performances,</hi> as on the other ſide, <hi>forſake the Publicans ſins, but retain his humility.</hi> I here is alſo a conſtitution, which although perhaps it pretend to more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and antiquity than it ought, yet muſt be acknowledged to be ancient and not unreaſonable, that we ſhould faſt <hi>Wedneſdaies and Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies,</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:33295:124"/> becauſe <hi>on the one the Lord was betrayed, and on the other cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</hi> and it is beyond controverſie <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conſtitute a Clem. Roman. collect. Lib 5. Cap.</hi> 14.</note> that the primitive Chriſtians uſed to have their ſolemn aſſemblies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe daies, not much leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant than upon the Lords daies.</p>
               <p>Secondly; that if this courſe be not alwaies to be uſed (which yet I know not what ſhould hinder, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man want leiſure) yet at certain ſeaſons, as in <hi>Lent and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber weeks,</hi> the commands and cuſtom of the Church will engage me to as much as this amounts to, if not to more. And he to whom the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of our preſent, and continued practice of the Catholick Church in devotionals ſignifie nothing, is ſurely a man of a ſtrange humourous ſanctity.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It is out of queſtion that there is no Chriſtian can walk ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and keep a good conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man, who hath not <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And one piece of Preparation as well for theſe daies as for the Lords day it ſelf (though indeed ſomewhat remote, or afarre off) it will be, to be diligent other daies in my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and well to husband both my
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:33295:126"/> time and eſtate. For if he, who hath not by his ſix daies labour made ſuch proviſion for himſelf and his, as that he may be without care of providing upon the ſeventh day, will ſcarce reſt that ſeventh day unto God without diſtraction (as ſeems to be ſuggeſted to us by thoſe words <hi>[Six daies ſhalt thou labour]</hi> being put into the fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, much leſs will he be able to allow himſelf conſtantly more time in a week than a ſeventh day comes to, to wit ſome part of every day, and a conſiderable part beſides of one of the ſix daies (which is to be his faſt) to the ſervice of God. I would therefore have every man not to incumber himſelf in this world more than he needs muſt. We ſhould learn to know when we have enough, and allow our ſelves ſome part of our time to enjoy as well as all to get. But this is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration very far off.</p>
               <p>The firſt act of more immediate preparation for theſe my faſting
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:33295:126"/> daies will be, prudently to contrive, upon foreſight and conſideration of my weeks buſineſs, what day or daies they are, in which I can beſt ſpare time for this work: and thoſe daies or that day will be the fitteſt to be pitched upon, in which I may the moſt freely converſe with God without the diſturbance, which much buſineſs neceſſarily brings. Beſides the time ſpent in my ordinacy courſe of devotions, which are not upon my faſts to be omitted, under pretence of making amends for them, or running them up into my penitentiary performances, I cannot upon thoſe daies when I allow leaſt, allow leſs than two hours and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the peculiar work of my faſts.

                  <p>Firſt, with underſtanding: ſo that it is not ſo much the repeating to my ſelf the words, as conſidering and digeſting the ſubſtance of them, which I muſt account reading of them. I muſt therefore read and ſtudy the Book as Schollars do their Books: and if there be any mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial thing, which I do not underſtand, mark it, ſo that I may inform my ſelf, by adviſing with ſome more able perſon than my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I muſt read all with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to my ſelf, remembring that all this concerns me, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee how it concerns me; whether I perform the duty I read of as I ſhould, or how I neglect it, &amp;c.</p>

Nor ought the third or fourth reading of a good, profitable and practical Treatiſe, to be tedious or unpleaſant to me: for that Chriſtian duties are not new, but have been, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes will be the ſame; and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of books do but confound plain heads. All wiſe men know, that to make a mans ſelf maſter of one good book is better than to have ſlightly read an hundred, which were not either throughly underſtood or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted. To keep therefore thus to one good Book, which may inſtruct me of the ſum of my Chriſtian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, till I have fully made it mine own, is my moſt ediſying courſe.</p>

                  <p>THis my Exerciſe of reading be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, it will be ſeaſonable now to fall to the examination of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:33295:131"/> my ſelf touching my ſins. And here I ſhall find a very good help of the former work of reading, eſpecially after ſome conſiderable uſe of it, when I am once come to know my ſeveral duties: for certain it is, <hi>No man can ſee what he hath done amiſs, what he hath left undone</hi> (which two heads, of <hi>Omiſſion</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> contain under them all actual ſins) till he ſeeth what he ſhould have done. Now this duty of Self-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, a man may be ſuppoſed either to be a ſtranger in, and little to have practiſed, or elſe to have been much in it, and to be throughly verſt in his heart and life.</p>
                  <p>He who is a ſtranger to it, hath unqueſtionably more work to do than the other. That he may therefore do his buſineſs throughly, he muſt begin with thoſe very firſt years which he can remember, and trace ſin from his inſancy, through his youth, to his riper and preſent years. He muſt ſee what Devil firſt entred him, I mean, what ſins
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:33295:131"/> firſt ſeized him, how they have grown up and continued with him: but this will be too long a work for an hour or two Such a perſon therefore had need to ſet apart whole dayes for this purpoſe, till he hath a little recovered himſelf, and ſet his accounts ſtraiter with God. Yet muſt he not, while he is enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after unknown or forgotten ſins, neglect to repent of his freſher and known tranſgreſſions. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo it is, that for the preſent he cannot recollect himſelf, and make a diligent ſearch into the whole courſe of his life, yet muſt he confeſs and bewail what he knows of himſelf, and together acknowledge how much he is in arrears, which he hath forgotten, or at preſent doth not ſee, and for all humbly beg mercy. But this not ſo, as wholly to put off ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquiry: but having this Faſt examined himſelf touching ſo many years or moneths (according as his life finds his thoughts work) upon his next Faſt proceed farther, and ſo
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:33295:132"/> on the next ſtill farther, till he come home to his preſent age. Now in this ſifting of my life, if I can, it will be very uſeful to me, and much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a diſtinct Repentance, to uſe my Pen, and through each year ſet down my ſins: By this means I ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble much better to conſider them, and ſo, both know more of my ſelf, and of the deceitful wayes, which ſin hath to gain upon me.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe as I owe to God Confeſſion and repentance of my ſins, ſo I owe alſo acknowledgment and thanks for his Mercies, therefore in this enquiry, it will be neceſſary to obſerve Gods remarkable Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and deliverances to me, record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe alſo year by year, as my ſins.</p>
                  <p>Thus will the ſight of his Mercies aggravate my ſins, and encreaſe my repentance; and the ſight of my ſins, parallel with his mercies, commend his goodneſs and inhance my thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; both which are ſingular benefits.</p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:33295:132"/>
                  <p>And becauſe even afflictions have their uſe. and are to be accounted for; if therefore I find any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable adverſity or croſs, with which God hath exerciſed me, this alſo is to be regiſtred as the former. If it did me good, <hi>I</hi> owe to God thanks for it: if not, <hi>I</hi> owe repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for being incorrigible.</p>
                  <p>Being thus come to my preſent time, it will become me not to run in arrears again, but every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Godly ſorrow workith repentance, which need not to be repented of.</hi> Now that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance may ſeem to conſiſt of two things, Of a <hi>full purpoſe</hi> of heart to forſake ſin, and of <hi>hearty endeavours</hi> againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>I</hi> ſay, <hi>I</hi> may not think <hi>I</hi> have repented of my ſin, till <hi>I</hi> have taken up a full purpoſe and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind againſt it for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As long as there is in me any intention of returning to it again, <hi>I</hi> am an impenitent wretch. Now ſuch purpoſe and reſolution the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſideration of my ſin is apt to beget: and therefore by laying ſuch thoughts truly home unto mine heart, by employing my mind much on them, <hi>I</hi> ought to endeavour to work my ſelf up to ſuch reſolution,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:33295:136"/> and never to ſit down contented, or think my ſelf penitent till <hi>I</hi> am ſo wrought upon. <hi>I</hi> ſhall not much need to be minded, that during ſuch endeavours I ought to intermix with my meditations, frequent peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Almighty God, whoſe Grace onely it is, which is ſufficient for me for the turning my heart from ſin.</p>
                  <p>Now purpoſes and reſolutions are rotten, except endeavours to fulfil them follow. This therefore is the ſecond part of repentance, that, as <hi>I</hi> have reſolved, ſo I endeavour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin.</p>
                  <p>And this endeavour againſt ſin ſeems to have two parts, the one of which may beſt be acted in my Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, the other muſt be acted any where and every where.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part of the endeavour againſt ſin is, to do what we can to mortifie the habit, that is, the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, readineſs and cuſtomary proneneſs, which we have to the ſin, which is to be forſaken. And that muſt be done.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:33295:136"/>1. By conſidering with my ſelf what means (or remedies) I can find out againſt that ſin. Certain it is, the more I can reſtrain or keep back my ſelf from the actual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or doing of any ſin, the more will the power of that ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in me, the leſs inclined ſhall I be thereto. Wherefore if I cannot at the firſt root out the habit, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that miſerable inclinedneſs, which I find thereto, yet let me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to find out ſuch means, which may keep me from the acting the ſin, and, I ſay, that cuſtomary proneneſs unto the ſin will by the grace of God decay.</p>
                  <p>Now in general it will be a true and proper remedy againſt any ſin to conſider the occaſions or induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which chieflly lead me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and to provide as well as I can againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Whether or no is it a ſin which is deeply rooted in my nature and conſtitution? or whether or no is it ſuch an one, which by my way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:33295:137"/> converſe and cuſtome, I have ſettled in my ſelf? If it be of the latter ſort, the breaking my ſelf of that cuſtome, the altering, as far as is poſſible, ſuch converſe as hath brought me into it, is a very good remedy againſt it. But if it be a ſin innate, and after a ſort planted in my very make and complexion, it is more difficult to ſubdue: But the way will be, 1. To take ſuch courſe with my ſelf, as that for the future I may keep my ſelf from the acting of it as much as may be: And 2. To make it a conſtant petition in my daily prayers to God, that he by that Spirit, by which he is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelf, would mortifie in me the affection and luſt, which I have after that ſin. And by perſevering in ſuch courſe, no doubt but at length, through the divine Grace, I ſhall overcome it. Theſe means therefore having conſulted of, attending to my particular ſin, the next ſtep which I am to take in the mortifying of it, is:</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:33295:137"/>2. To reſolve there before God, diligently to uſe thoſe means, which I have particularly conſulted of, and ſo forthwith to order and contrive all my affairs (as far as in me lies) that I may without any partiality uſe them all, according to the beſt of my skill, and in the moſt effectual manner that I know.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of the endeavour againſt ſin (which will not be ſo much the work of my Cloſet, as of my life) is diligence in the uſing of theſe means (which I have thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of, found out and reſolved upon) whereever I am, and when ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have opportunity.</p>
                  <p>Now that <hi>I</hi> may ſo do, it will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much help, if I write down theſe reſolutions before God in my priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which <hi>I</hi> am to do in mine Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptal; where alſo <hi>I</hi> am to record every dayes faſting, and the iſſue thereof, what <hi>I</hi> found new in mine eſtate, what <hi>I</hi> reſolved on, what means <hi>I</hi> conſidered of againſt ſuch and ſuch ſins! We find, they not
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:33295:138"/> onely made a <hi>Covenant,</hi> but put it in <hi>writing, and ſealed it before the Lord,</hi> in their ſolemn Faſt, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 38. This will be one way to ſecure me againſt being ſlighty in my Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials: and it may beſides much both confirm and quicken me in my exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of theſe my reſolves, to read them over written by my mine own hand before God.</p>
                  <p>And being thus regiſtred, it will be good for me to be often (when I come into my Cloſet about my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions and examine my ſelf) look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on and reading them over, leaſt forgetfulneſs ſhould betray me into the breach of them.</p>

And in this caſe it may be, that good practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal book which I have choſen to my ſelf to read and ſtudy, may much help me, and diſcover to me the grievouſneſs of it in its own nature. This being done, I conſider how grievous my commiſsion of it is: what particular aggravations all my actions of this kind admit. Here <hi>I</hi> open this my book, and examine it by thoſe aggravating particulars mentioned: All which cordially employing my thoughts upon, I

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Meditations being finiſhed, and, as briefly as I can, entred, it remains that I enter my reſolution
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:33295:142"/> of endeavour againſt this ſin as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and then ſtudy meet remedies thereto. Now this ſin not being alwaies natural to them in whom it is found, but adventitious, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns me to conſider, as before ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, how I came to be guilty hereof, and to ſuit my remedies to thoſe occaſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It may be I <hi>am buſied about many things,</hi> and ſo either neglect all, (or what chiefly concerns me) my proper duties. Perhaps I cannot endure that which ſhould be my buſineſs, but am fickle, deſultory, and rambling in mine employment, and though I am not much guilty of doing nothing, yet do I not do what I ſhould: and this is undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly a piece of idleneſs, (as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) for a man to neglect the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſeaſon and of his calling, and to be moſt taken up in things which leaſt concern him. Now here the remedy will be, to conſider what it is that is my proper buſineſs: to put my work into a certain mold
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:33295:142"/> and order: and then to ſet my ſelf a task daily, and engage my ſelf (as well as I can) to ſo much of it, before I divert to any Eccentrical occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I mean to the buſying my ſelf in things, which do not properly concern me.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may be I uſe to ſit and talk away my time with friends and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: much goes in idle viſits: I have a nature, which is too ſociable, and when I meet with company to my mind, I know not how to deny my ſelfe of their ſociety and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: and if I do not meet with ſuch, I am apt to leave my buſineſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and go ſeek ſuch. Here the remedy will be (partly the ſame with the former) prudently to proportion my time to my buſineſs: So much of my buſineſs have I reſolved to do: that reſolution muſt not be broken: ſo much time will that work take me up: ſo much, my devotions: wherefore I have but ſo much left for ſociety: more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt not take. If therefore
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:33295:143"/> I am lite into any acceptable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, it will become me often to conſider, how goes the time? ſo much of my impoſed task yet lies undone, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It may be much of my time is ſpent in dulneſs, ſitting ſtill, &amp;c. It may be my conſtitution is ſuch that if I eat heartily, I am a great while unfit for my work, and ſo feeding freely laies upon me a kind of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of being idle. Here the remedy will be to reſolve upon a ſparer diet, to bridle mine appetite and eat leſs when I do eat; or if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not that, to eat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eldomer, and to be at leaſt but once a day unfit for my work: which time of unfitneſs, if I will well husband my time, I may beſt allow for ſociety; it will be fit enough for that.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It may be vexations, anger, or giving way to paſſion many times indiſpoſeth me for buſineſs. Here the remedy will be to watch againſt ſuch diſturbances, to endeavour meekneſs, patience, and the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:33295:143"/> of unruly affections.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It may be ſollicitude about this world, thoughtfulneſs, cares take up many of mine hours: and then, mine head being full, I cannot call home my mind and fall to work: and when by my care I cannot find any expedient for what I ſought, this breeds diſcontent, envy of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens eaſe, happineſs, freedom, &amp;c. And ſeriouſly it is a great deal of time, which narrow fortunes thus ſteal away from ſome men. Here the remedy will be, ſtudy of content, frugality, wiſe husbanding mine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, proportioning mine expences to my revenues. And ſo what ever I find to be the occaſion of my loſs or expence of time, let me ſtudy a ſuitable remedy thereto, and regiſter as well the occaſion as its correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding remedy. Let me then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to reſolve upon the uſe of ſuch remedies, and to order my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affairs in ſuch ſort that I may uſe them with the beſt advantage: and ſuch reſolutions let me alwaies
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:33295:144"/> enter upon my <hi>Accomptal,</hi> for the faſtning them both upon mine heart and memory.</p>

But ſurely, if I throughly underſtand the Practice of it, as it hath been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſcribed, I cannot be at a loſs in what ſort it ought to be exerciſed, when I find my ſelf guilty of one particular fall or ſin, the habit, or cuſtomary readineſs to which, I have not yet contracted: for the ſubſtance of my work is ſtill the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:33295:144"/>
                  <p>Having in mine examination of my ſelf found my ſelf guilty, I am by attent conſideration of that ſin, whereof I am guilty, both in it ſelf, and as it is mine, to endeavour to affect my heart therewith, ſo that I may truly ſorrow for it: and though it may be I may truly conclude, that it hath not yet got fully a roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting within me, yet for as much as the firſt or ſecond commiſſion thereof hath in probability made me more inclined and eaſie thereto, than I was, when my mind, having been never much bent this way, was thitherwards more inflexible, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought I to ſtudy and conſult how for the future to ſecure and confirm my ſoul againſt any relapſes or ſecond backſlidings: and after ſuch conſultation to reſolve and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my ſelf with all poſſible ſtrength againſt it.</p>
                  <p>One thing more, in caſe of ſins committed, or wrong done unto my neighbour, is yet requiſite to the making my repentance ſincere and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:33295:145"/> through; and that is, that I forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with upon ſight of the ſin, if poſſible, make reſtitution: otherwiſe that I make it as ſoon as I am able; and in caſe I am not likely to be able to make it, that I endeavour by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of mine offence to ſeek for reconciliation unto him, whom I have ſo wronged. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity hereof may be concluded from what hath been above ſaid, that repentance cannot be true, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be an amendment. Now moſt evident it is, that while I ſuffer the wrong done yet to remain or continue, I am ſtill injurious; and ſo conſequently there is no amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore no repentance.

                  <p>BEſides Repentance, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid that God requireth Faith of us in order to pardon of our ſins: and it is moſt certain, if we underſtand faith as we ought. But it is as certain, that people are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily very much miſtaken in the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:33295:146"/> nature of Faith; as it is not unuſual for us to be in ſuch things, the names whereof are takne in ſuch different <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ham.</hi> Pract. Catech. Lib. 1. Sect. 3.</note> ſenſes as the name of Faith is in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Now faith we all of us know ſig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifies Belief: and therein doth the nature of it lye. Him that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in is God: that which we believe is his Word. So then, Faith is a full belief or credence of the whole Word of God; and eſpecially of the Goſpel; a receiving it and every part of it in a way ſuitable to the matter of it; agreeing to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is therein affirmed, as being true; believing all the promiſes, that God will never fail on his part, unleſs we do on ours; ſetting our ſelves to fulfil all the commands, as believing all that is commanded to be our duty and of indiſpenſible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to ſalvation; trembling at all the threatnings, as being perſwaded God will be as good as his word, and puniſh all impenitent ſinners. Faith, I ſay, is the hearty and ſincere
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:33295:147"/> embracing and being perſwaded of the whole word and theſe its parts after this ſort: and we muſt not ſingle out the promiſes and believe them alone; for all commands and threats are no leſs the word of God than are the promiſes, and therefore muſt be as much believed, nor ſhall any one ever be juſtified who doth not thus believe.</p>
                  <p>If it be asked, whether it be not faith in the free promiſes of the Goſpel, or a truſting to God through Chriſt, that he will pardon my ſin, which doth chiefly juſtifie me, I ſay, No: and that the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the doctrine of the Goſpel, the receiving every command and threat ſo deeply into my heart, as that the belief of the one turns forthwith into obedience, and of the other into obedience, and of the other into an holy fear, (which are the other parts of faith) cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be either in their own nature inferiour unto that truſt, or leſs either valued or required by God. I do not ſay that God accepts
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:33295:147"/> of any of them, or all of them, for their worth: (He accepts of them, and of the perſon, in whom they are purely through Chriſt; through his merits doth he impute this faith to ſuch perſon for righteouſneſs, that is reckon and accept of this his cordial and impartial receiving his whole Goſpel after this ſort, as well as if he had performed perfect and unſinning obedience, as he was firſt bound:) but this I ſay (and that upon the evidence already hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that juſtification, or the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of ſin, is no more appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that one act of faith, which we call truſt, than to thoſe other; and that I cannot (if compariſon in this caſe be made) but account thoſe other acts (that impartial ſubmitting and devoting the ſould to obedience anſwerably to every command, that true reſting in the fear of God) as the more principal, worthy, and I am ſure, leſs to be ſuſpected acts of faith: At the leaſt I cannot conceive, what we call a juſtifying faith to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:33295:148"/> proceed any otherwiſe than as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I do believe the promiſe of pardon of ſin to be true, and God to be faithful, and that without all doubt God will not fail on his part, except I fail on mine. God will not fail to give the promiſed bleſſing, if I fail not to perform the condition, upon which he hath promiſed it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I therefore forthwith ſet my ſelf about the condition, or duty required, as I expect the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or promiſed mercy from God: I ſorrow for my ſins; I endeavour amendment of life. I cleave unto God with full purpoſe of impartial obedience.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, having done ſo, I do not believe that all this is worth any thing in it ſelf, but that it is through the meer grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus, that I muſt be accepted, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and ſaved. Wherefore I truſt to God according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (the condition of which I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndeavoured to fulfil) that he will
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:33295:148"/> through Chriſt pardon all my ſins, and reckon this my faith to me for righteouſneſs, to truſt for the pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my ſins upon any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her terms is unbelief and preſumption: for it is a believing God will pardon my ſins upon their terms, than he hath ſaid he would ever pardon ſin, and that is a believing God will be falſe.</p>
                  <p>But now let the caſe be put, that ſome grievous ſinner, much hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled under the ſenſe of his noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious wickedneſs, doth, as before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, believe the promiſe to be true as it is, ſet himſelf about the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling its condition (ſorrowing repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp;c.) believe all that he doth to be in its ſelf worth nothing, but yet Chriſts merits to be of infinite worth, through which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he dare not truſt for the pardon of his ſins, as remembring them to be ſo great, and doubting leſt he hath not yet performed the condition, which the promiſe of the pardon of ſin through Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:33295:149"/> requires, and in this temper dies; Put, I ſay, this caſe, ſhall we think this man hath not a true and juſtifying faith? He hath ſurely; and it may be a truer faith, than hath many an one who yet hath more of the truſt. But yet it is evident he hath not this truſt: for he durſt not, through ſenſe of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs animate himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Seeing therefore, that it is very poſſible a man may in ſuch caſe be juſtified without that act of faith, I conclude that juſtification is not appropriate unto it, that is, that a truſting in God that he through Chriſt will pardon my ſin, is not that act of faith which chiefly juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies me, and that they are very much miſtaken, who take this (by it ſelf) to be the true nature of juſtifying faith, that they believe God will pardon their ſin for Chriſts ſake. ſo then, I now ſee the courſe which I am to take, in my humiliation, to ſue out the pardon of my ſin. I am to believe, that God will not fail on
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:33295:149"/> his part, if I do fail on mine: I am therefore to repent of my ſins, as before I have been taught, and perſiſt in amendment of life, all the while truſting in the grace of God through Chriſt, according to the promiſe of the Goſpel, that I doing thus, my ſins ſhall not be laid to my charge, as being taken away by the croſs of Chriſt, in whoſe merits I have, through this my faith and the mercy of God to me, a ſhare.</p>

                  <p>O Thou Great, Holy, and Fearful God, unto whom all things are naked and open; and before whom, as being of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, nothing that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous ſhall ſtand. I even bluſh and dread to appear before thee: For in me there is nothing but iniquity that thou canſt behold. Iniquity indeed is too ſoft a word: I am nothing but filth. I have ſinned againſt Heaven and before thee; and am ſo far unworthy of being called thy ſon, that I am not fit to be called thy ſervant: but deſerve rather as a rebell, as a faithleſs and treacherous wretch againſt thy Majeſty, to be deſtroyed of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:33295:152"/> to have all thy wrath and plagues to meet in me, and to be made unto the world an example of thy ſeverity and revenging juſtice, that by me men might learn no more to preſume and backſlide.</p>
                  <p>But there is mercy with thee, O Lord, that thou mayeſt be feared and ſought unto: Nor haſt thou, as thou haſt proteſted, any pleaſure in the death of ſinners; but art ſo deſirous, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and be healed, that thou haſt not ſpared thy very onely begotten Son, but haſt given him to ſeek, and, by death it ſelf, to ſave the loſt ſons of men; promiſing, that of all thoſe, who through him come home unto thee, thou wilt by no means caſt off any.

My youth, what was it, but a vain and brutiſh, a mad and ſenſual age! As to that ſmall notice, which therein I had of thy will and nature, how little cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit did I give unto it, and how ineffectual was it upon me, either to the quickening me

But as to my riper years, O Lord, I know not what to ſay: I ſhould in truth ſit down aſtoniſhed before thee, but that I want a due ſenſe of my ſinfulneſſe. Mine iniquities are gone over my head: That they are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than I can bear, is little; they are greater than I can comprehend or number. Nay if I ſhould let paſs my ſins of ignorance, of infirmity, of heedleſneſs and inadvertency, (by which notwithſtanding I ſeriouſly acknowledge my ſelf times without number, to have diſhonoured and provoked thee:) If I ſhould inſiſt only upon my knowing, preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptious and wilful ſins, even theſe, O Lord, it were impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

How many wilful neglects, yea even contempts, of my duty! How many reſolute perpetrations of horrid crimes; ſuch which I now am aſhamed even to think of, yet did not then bluſh to commit; ſins, the heinouſneſs whereof being conſidered, if I could do nothing elſe but mourn over them all my dayes, though I ſhould weep as my Saviour ſweat, in bloud, under un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known agonies, I could not

Suffer not this my righteouſneſs to be onely, as a morning cloud or early dew, ſoon paſſing away, but let thy grace alwayes dwelling in me keep open in my ſoul an ever flowing fountain of ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, that I may go on thus mourning to mourn over my ſins, and perfecting holineſs in thy fear; accounting all little enough, if ſo be I may but in the end obtain mercy. And this my penitent return (at leaſt hearty endeavour of ſuch return) accompanied with perſevering ſtudy of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:33295:162"/> obedience to thee, do thou, however moſt unworthy in it ſelf, through the perfect merits of thy Son accept, waſhing away all my ſins (both the iniquities of my youth and tranſgreſſions of my riper years, as well known as unknown) eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <note place="margin">Here mention thy chiefeſt ſin or ſins.</note> my [**] in his bloud; and reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to thy gracious Covenant, this my faith (which by ſuch works as theſe ſhall diſcover it ſelf to be alive and true) unto me for righteouſneſs.

                  <p>As to all my outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, by thy good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be thou pleaſed ſo to overrule all events, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever befals me may work together to me for good.

And I do moſt ſeriouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that in all the judgments, which thou haſt at any time laid upon me, thou haſt uſed much mercy. All the paines, which my body hath felt; all the loſſes, which have impaired my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; all the ſlanders, which have blaſted my name [par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly

                  </p>
                  <p>And not onely upon me, O Lord, but upon all men do thou have mercy, according to the gracious pleaſure of thine own moſt holy Will. Eſpecially upon the univerſal Church; Enlarge thou its

                  <p>Finally, O Lord, I bleſs and praiſe thy glorious grace, for all thoſe bleſſings which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and thoſe particular deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, whether ancient or
